Hi Lars,

I don't think that the issue is here the two MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE 
modaliases in my ltc6951 driver. I have them both for the spi_device_id 
and also the of_device_id defined.
And I believe that if any of them would be missing, then manual modprobe 
of the ltc6951 driver would fail too.

The issue is that it does not get automatically enumerated when my 
custom spi controller get loaded (i can see after boot that the spi 
controller is alive when looking into /proc/modules)

However, the spi slave device is not alive. The strange thing is that 
this does work if I connect the spi slave to the onboard SPI controller 
which resides inside the Zynq MPSoC.. (after putting the ltc slave in 
the tree under that controller)

Regards

Henk
