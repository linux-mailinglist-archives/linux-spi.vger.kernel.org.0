Yes, i did look at existing hardware bindings, and cannot seem to find 
out any other suitable place. I can definitely look again.

Sure, will add them.

Sure, i will add this description in the binding document in the future

Yes, an espi channel provides a means to allow multiple independent 
flows of traffic to share the same physical bus. Each of the channels 
has its own dedicated resources such as queue and flow control.

A channel is a logical communication pathway or interface between the 
chipset and peripheral devices. The concept of channels in the ESPI 
protocol helps organize and manage different types of communication 
between the chipset and peripherals. Each channel may have its own set 
of protocols, data transfer rates, and supported features, tailored to 
the requirements of the devices it serves.

I am not sure I understand, can you please elaborate ?

I would like to inquire about the rationale behind this request. Based 
on previous feedback received from the upstream efforts 
[https://lore.kernel.org/openbmc/HK0PR06MB37798462D17443C697433D7191D09@HK0PR06MB3779.apcprd06.prod.outlook.com/], 
suggestions were made to model the flash channel by utilizing the mtd 
subsystem, the virtual wire channel by utilizing the GPIO subsystem, and 
to consider the OOB channel as a type of i2c device, thereby allowing it 
to be utilized by the existing in-kernel MCTP subsystem, among others. 
My intention was to prioritize upstreaming the flash channel binding, 
along with its driver code, before proceeding to address other channels. 
I am curious to understand if it is a strict requirement to have the 
complete binding upstreamed before addressing the device drivers code.
