Then I'd argue your ROM code is broken because it doesn't respect
the SFDP bit which tells you the data is swapped. I'm not implying
we should ignore that case.

What assumption, that everyone reads it the same way and swap the bytes
if necessary?

I've also checked the flexspi, doesn't have such an option either.

We need a reference. And IMHO this reference is that if the SFDP
tells us the bytes are swapped, we need to swap em in 8D-8D-8D,
any software which deviates from that is broken; which doesn't
mean we should not try to be compatible with it. But we - as in the
SPI-NOR subsystem - should not be broken too and maybe we are
getting to be the reference..

Is there any sofware yet where we can lose compatibility with? This
patch series will break it anyway if you are using this combination
of atmel qspi controller and macronix flash. So apparently we don't
care about that. Yes there might be some fallout now, but if we just
ignore the problem now, the fallout later might be even bigger.

Imagine, someone with an SPI controller without swapping comes
along and want to use that macronix flash with a boot rom doing
single bit accesses. It doesn't work, does it? So, what we are
doing then?

I don't think a Kconfig is the way to go here neither. What if you
have two flashes and you want one with and one without?
