You're replying inline too early:

>> as was suggested, as you will find in my tree

As I said, I implemented it in my driver:

https://github.com/afaerber/linux/commit/bbecf951348c7de8ba922c6c002a09369b717d82

Thus me saying you are unnecessarily duplicating work that I already
did, without ping'ing the thread or me and claiming the credit for an
implementation change which I already did myself.

Also note this 5-in-4 optimization:

https://github.com/afaerber/linux/commit/ff8284b6ed9dc1e354c35840afdaf50b1cd97fea

And several more chipsets being covered.

Realtek has a boot ROM at the beginning of memory space, which has been
a problem from the first RFC and for most bootloaders required to tweak
the kernel's text offset for successful boot. (Some not Open Source (LK)
and/or not openly flashable.)

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2017-February/487718.html

In 2020 that arm64 feature got removed without any further discussion:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20200825135440.11288-1-ardb@kernel.org/

I've tried to revert it, but that's been a pain:

https://github.com/afaerber/linux/commit/0d2c647781bc89ee95bfa7b80d71237c7ebea230

Is there any other API that would allow userspace to write to the buffer
and bitblt parts to the SPI device?

Thinking of some optimizations I implemented in my driver to avoid
unnecessary SPI transfers:
