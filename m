Yes, if the information is discoverable, we should propagate it to the
spi layer so that the relevant action is taken, from the most desirable
to the less desirable:
- adapting the sampling point
- lowering the bus frequency
- refusing the probe if none of these solutions are possible

Can you update your patchset with this in mind?

Thanks,
