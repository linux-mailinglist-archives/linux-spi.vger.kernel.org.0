Agreed, I would recommend splitting this series into logically separate 
changes, for example the W1 EEPROM driver could be separate, some extra 
features on the mikroBUS driver could be separate patches or be part of 
a separate series later.

Thank you, please keep yourself as the primary author as you are putting 
in the effort to get the driver upstream and you will need to work on 
multiple revisions to address maintainer feedback and I feel you should 
get credit for that, please put my BeagleBoard.org e-mail with 
Co-developed-by tag as most of the work was done before I moved to the 
Linux team at TI.

The reasoning behind this is that these patches go in to separate 
maintainer trees and without the bindings merged first the device tree 
changes cannot be validated, thus it is a usual practice to get the 
bindings and driver merged first and the device tree changes to go in 
the next cycle. Another alternative is you can point to your fork with 
all the changes together.

Agreed, even with those you can get close to 100 add-on boards working.
But do keep the extension to the greybus manifest .etc for all 
buses/devices so that approvals for extending the greybus manifest is 
common.
