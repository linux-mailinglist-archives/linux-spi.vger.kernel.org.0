Maybe that was the original intention but since then the Macronix
driver has been merged and supports (at lest does not reject) these
modes.

I don't know if the Macronix driver really supports it or if it is the
driver that is doing the wrong checks but in appearance such mixed mode
could be used.

Nice, I might take that as well indeed in order to make the checks a
little bit more robust.
