You need to use spi_register_controller() in apple_spi_probe()
(*not* the devm variant) and invoke spi_unregister_controller()
first thing in apple_spi_remove().

Otherwise you've got an ordering issue on driver unbind:
__device_release_driver() first calls the ->remove hook and only
then devres_release_all().  You're disabling the clock and interrupts
in the ->remove hook, rendering the controller unusable.  Yet the
expectation is that until spi_unregister_controller() returns,
the controller works and its slaves are accessible.

This is especially important if there are slaves attached to the
controller which perform SPI transfers in their ->remove hooks,
e.g. to quiesce interrupts on the slaves.  Those transfers won't
work the way you've structured the code now.

spi-sifive.c, from which you've derived this, is broken.  As are
a couple dozen other drivers.  I've fixed some of them,
but haven't gotten around to fixing them all.  Just trying to
prevent more brokenness from entering the codebase.

Thanks,

Lukas
