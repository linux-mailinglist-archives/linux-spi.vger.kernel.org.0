And its not 6 bytes.. it's usually only three. The last three bytes will
probably be undefined. So the might return ff or just wrap around and
return the first three bytes again.

Is there a datasheet where you can read how the calibration is done? Is 
this
the same for all i/o pads or individual per i/o pad?

I cannot see where the op to read the id is coming from. Are you relying
on the fact that a RDID is the first command which gets executed. If so,
please don't.

Do you calibrate only one pad? RDID (9f) is  single bit i/o, right? And
I guess you are calibrating with the highest frequency, are
we sure that RDID will work with any frequency (on any flash).

Honestly, I'm not sure this is the way to go. Pratyush proposed solution
to have a dedicated memory area within the flash array with a know 
pattern
seems to make more sense, because you are calibrating on the thing you 
are going
to use later, that is quad/ocal read with the fastest frequency.

So how you know that this is a RDID instruction?
