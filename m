Or, y'know, we could just reach a productive conclusion rather than 
doom-and-gloom catastrophising. I apologise for not having much time for 
non-work-related kernel hacking at the moment, but it didn't seem 
particularly urgent to follow up on this in the middle of a merge window 
anyway. In the course of helpfully being left to address my own review 
feedback, I did eventually get round to implementing the intermediate 
"leds" node[1] last weekend, but having now stumbled across the 
matrix-keymap helpers and common "linux,keymap" property, I'm personally 
inclined to think that that's even cleaner than a "keys" node with 
children that we'd have to write more parsing code for, and thus may 
well make the whole intermediate node notion moot anyway. If only anyone 
had pointed it out sooner...

Thanks,
Robin.
