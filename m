As I replied to Boris's email previously.
I think I have fixed the problem and the root cause is the our NFC's TX 
FIFO 
counter do a unnecessary reset in CS control function.
currently, doing CS# control in ->exec_op() is OK to me.

In addition, by Jones's comments about MFD, 
I will re-submit this raw NAND ctlr driver instead of MFD and raw-nand. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------->
MFD is for registering child devices of chips which offer 
genuine cross-subsystem functionality. 

It is not designed for mode selecting, or as a place to shove shared code 
just because a better location doesn't appear to exist.
