Hi Geert,

Thank you for the update.

In fact, the ultimate solution would be to have it solved at the level
of the spi subsystem:

  * /spi_device struct/ would contain extra callback which returns msg
    to be sent for no operation.
  * spi_device struct would contain a pointer to the list describing the
    given daisy chain (list of spi_devices on the chain)
  * /spi_device struct /would contain extra u8 daisy_chain_msg_length
    indicating length of a command of the addressed device if it's on
    the daisy chain
    For example, in case of the ltc2634 device, the regular message
    consists of 24 bits, but when device is a part of a daisy chain, the
    messages are 32 bits. This 32 would be stored in
    /daisy_chain_msg_length./
  * When /spi_write/ was called (include/linux/spi/spi.h), the
    /spi_message_init_with_transfer/ would create a msg of length equal
    to a sum of /daisy_chain_msg_length/ of all devices on the chain.
    Afterwards, in /spi_message_init_with_transfers/, the actual message
    would be filled with the command of the addressed device on the
    chain and no_operation content for all other devices on the chain
    not being addressed
  * I think in such a case, the /daisy-chained-devices /property would
    be not used, as chains would be build basing on the assigned
    chipselect (reg property).

If you agree with the above description, I could try to implement it. Of
course any suggestion are welcome, however, I would like to have a
working solution until end of this week, so I would appreciate an active
feedback. As my SoC works with kernel v4.19, I would implement it for
it, test it, and move it afterwards to the master version (I hope, there
were no big changes in the SPI subsystem, right?).

Regards,

Adrian
