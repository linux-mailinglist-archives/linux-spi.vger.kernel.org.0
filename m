To me, a transfer is one transaction with the SPI controller. In most
implementations of ->exec_op(), the controller gets configured once for
the full transfer to take place. This contrasts with the fallback case
that does from 1 to 4 transfers (cmd, addr, dummy & data, with the last
three being optional).

One transfer feels closer to what happens from my point-of-view. What
would be your definition of a transfer? Or the "official" one that the
sysfs entry represents?

Thanks!

I see where you are coming from. I'll do so on the next revision (if
there is one).

A first step would be to have the sysfs SPI statistics API be described
inside Documentation/. That is outside the scope of this patch
though. :-)

Same.

Mark Brown gave an answer to this. Indeed, with regular SPI operations,
one message doesn't map to one transfer.

I have indeed done some benchmarking. I was not able to measure anything
significant. Neither doing timings of end-to-end testing by reading
loads of data over UBIFS, nor by using ftrace's function_graph.

I've asked myself the same question. It is being done unconditionally on
regular SPI ops, so I guess the question has been answered previously:
no need to make this conditional.

See spi_statistics_add_transfer_stats() in drivers/spi/spi.c.

Thanks for your review! I don't regret adding you to the Cc list.
