If we modify these macros, it would require other spinand vendor drivers 
to change (toshiba, micron, etc).
The older macros suit them well, should we go about changing them to 
this new macro (will require re-testing all of them),
or can we keep them unchanged and have new set of macros with different 
name (please give suggestion for it) for op variants.
