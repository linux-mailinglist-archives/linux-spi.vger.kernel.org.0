Hello all,

Here is a new iteration for this big series, this time I am reincluding
the initial binding changes because they changed very slightly and at
least it gives reviewers a better understanding of the entire work
again.

Once I'll get Rob's ack on the final DT change I will apply (in a topic
branch) all the patches until "mtd: nand: ecc: Provide a helper to
retrieve a pipelined engine device", which brings everything that is
needed to support external engines, as well as the Macronix example.

I will need further acknowledgments for the second half which brings
support for pipelined engines (even though I hope we are close to an
agreement now).

Cheers,
Miqu√®l

Changes in v6:
* Re-include the first patches because a few things have changed in the
  bindings. These are only style changes as Rob asked to group every
  property above or below the description field, which I applied to all
  the binding commits, but without any further update.
* Created a spi-mem capabilities structure. Put that one in the spi-mem
  ops strucure and ensured that all the controllers provided one.
* Created a default "no-caps" empty instance that controller drivers can
  point to by default.
* Dropped the spi_mem_generic_defaults_op() intermediate helper entirely
  (not needed anymore).

Changes in v5:
* Moved a helper in the core as it seems that it will be useful for
  other ECC engines as well (Xiangsheng Hou for Mediatek will need it).
* Changed the parameters of the spi_mem_generic_supports_op() function
  in order to take a structure as input instead of a list of arguments,
  which will be much easier to complement in the future if ever needed.

Changes in v4:
* The first half of the series has been left aside (all the binding
  changes + the external mode in the Macronix driver), now let's focus
  on the pipelined mode.
* Added the ecc_en spi_mem_op structure parameter in a dedicated commit.
* Introduced a new helper for supporting generically the supported ops.
* Used this new helper in the macronix driver.
* By default all the other drivers would refuse a spi_mem_op with ecc_en
  enabled.

Changes in v3:
* Added Mark's R-by.
* Added a commit changing the initialization order between the dirmaps
  and the ECC engine so that the core might now if we are using a
  pipelined engine or not.
* Stopped creating additional dirmaps with ECC if the engine is not a
  pipelined engine.
* Solved the kernel test robot reports. In particular, I added a
  dependency on MTD_NAND_ECC to Macronix SPI controller driver.
* Added a patch to clean the NAND controller yaml file before moving
  some bits to nand-chip.yaml. This addresses the comments made by Rob
  about the useless allOf's.
* Used platform_get_irq_byname_optional() in order to avoid useless
  warnings when there is no IRQ.

Changes in v2:
* Fixed the bindings and added Rob's acks when relevant.
* Added locking in the ECC engine driver.
* Brought more changes in the core in order to bring the ECC information
  into the spi_mem_op structure with the idea of avoiding any races
  between parallel calls on the same engine.
* Reorganized the ECC driver entirely in order to have a per-engine mxic
  structure plus a per-NAND context. This lead to a number of changes
  internally which cannot all be listed.

Changes since the RFC:
* Rebased on top of v5.15-rc1.
* Fixed the dirmap configuration.
* Added the various tags received.
* Fixed the bindings as reported by the robots.
* Fixed the return value of the helper counting bitflips.
* Included a fix from Jaime Liao in the external pattern logic.
* Added the yaml conversion of Macronix SPI controller description.
* Added the yaml conversion of the SPI-NAND description.
* Created a nand-chip.yaml file to share properties between SPI-NAND and
  raw NAND.
