mikroBUS add-on boards do not need to have EEPROM, but they can have it. 
Simply put, EEPROM is not part of mikroBUS specification, but you will 
find a lot (especially newer) addon boards with support for EEPROM manifest.

Regardless, this patch actually does not contain any code for EEPROM 
support I have just mentioned it to give more context on why mikroBUS 
manifest is the focus of this patch instead of DT overlay or something 
else.

Yes, I was replying to the question posed by Michael. Since this happens 
in the driver and not in the devicetree, I needed to explain the working 
of the driver:


 > How do you attach a kernel driver to it's spi port for example?


For more hardware side, the bindings are for mikrobus connector rather 
than for any addon board. Thus, while an addon board might not use some 
of the pins, the connector still needs to have all the pins and 
associated controllers.
