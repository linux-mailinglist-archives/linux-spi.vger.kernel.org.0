I would question your use of "most" here...

This is one of the many hazards of using spidev, it is not an especially
safe or robust interface.  To the extent that there's an issue here it's
something that should be addressed at the spidev level, though I expect
that there will be some users who want this facility and would want a
way to disable any access controls.  I recommend writing device drivers
in kernel.

No, it is exactly the specified behaviour of cs_change.  Please see
spi.h.
