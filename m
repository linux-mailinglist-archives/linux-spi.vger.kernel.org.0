I'm still wondering what this is delaying? From what to what? We already 
have numerous common delay properties for SPI. If one of those doesn't 
work, then should this be a new common property? And if common, I think 
time units is better to use than degrees.

If this is vendor specific, then I'd just use the register value. 
There's not much point in using common units unless it is a common 
property.
