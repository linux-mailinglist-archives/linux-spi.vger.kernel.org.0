Well, what I expected to have was something like:

dt:		<property> = <uint64>, <uint64>;

It seemed like the only possible way (that the tooling would validate)
was to use:

bindings:	$ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint64-matrix

So I assumed I was defining a matrix of AxB elements, where A is the
number of devices I want to "stack" and B is the number of values
needed to describe its size, so 1.

I realized that the following example, which I was expecting to work,
was failing:

bindings:	$ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint64-array
dt:		<property> = <uint64>, <uint64>;

Indeed, as you propose, this actually works but describes two values
(tied somehow) into a single element, which is not exactly what I
wanted:

bindings: 	$ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint64-array
dt:		<property> = <uint64 uint64>;

But more disturbing, all the following constructions worked, when using
32-bits values instead:

bindings: 	$ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-array
dt:		<property> = <uint32 uint32>;

bindings: 	$ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-array
dt:		<property> = <uint32>, <uint32>;

bindings: 	$ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-matrix
dt:		<property> = <uint32 uint32>;

bindings: 	$ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-matrix
dt:		<property> = <uint32>, <uint32>;

I am fine waiting a bit if you think there is a need for some tooling
update on your side. Otherwise, do you really think that this solution
is the one we should really use?

bindings: 	$ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint64-array
dt:		<property> = <uint64 uint64>;

Because from my point of view it does not match what we usually do for
other "types" of elements, such as:

dt:		<property> = <phandle1 index1>, <phandle2 index2>;

or

dt:		<property> = <small-val1>, <small-val2>;

Yes, that is what I wanted to describe.

In my recent contributions you always preferred to bound things as much
as possible, even though later it might become necessary to loosen the
constraint. Right now I see the use of these properties for 2 devices,
but in theory there is no limit.

Of course if we switch to the array representation I suppose I should
stick to:

+    minItems: 2
+    maxItems: 2
