Just a gentle ping, this patch set was posted to the list 5 weeks ago,
has all necessary acks and has been tested successfully by 2 people
besides myself.

Do you have any thoughts on it?  Any objections?

In case the patches no longer apply cleanly I've prepared this branch
based on your for-next branch of Aug 23 from which you can merge if
you prefer that:

https://github.com/l1k/linux/commits/bcm2835_spi_simplex_v1

However I can also repost if necessary.

(PS: Apologies for misspelling your name as "Marc" in my e-mail of Aug 24.)

Thanks,

Lukas
