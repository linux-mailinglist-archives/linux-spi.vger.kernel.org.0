Yes, that is certainly correct. I was thinking of the user
experience. Sometimes you have eval board with that connector
to tinker around with different modules. Therefore I thought it
would be nice to have an userspace spi device by default for
first steps and tinkering.

There is UART which you can use by just opening the tty. There is
I2C which you can use by the i2ctools. There are GPIOs and PWM
which can also be used either by sysfs or the gpio-utils. But there
is no SPI device which can be used by the spi-tools.

But as I said, that is something up to you to decide :)
