Hello Harald,
     My concern is if possible to create the udev(spidev) by adding the 
device-tree node. Although the way of using the udev rule is fine, I 
think the way of adding device-tree node also suitable for some scenarios.

     Referring to Kumar's examples, I guess the virtio spi device-tree 
should be like:

     virtio-spi@4b013000 {
         compatible = "virtio,mmio";
         reg = <0x4b013000 0x1000>;
         interrupts = <0 497 4>;

         spi {
             compatible = "virtio,device45";
             #address-cells = <1>;
             #size-cells = <0>;

             spidev@0 {
                 compatible = "xxx";
                 reg = <0>;
                 spi-max-frequency = <100000>;
             };
         };
     };

     Just like virtio-i2c node, virtio-spi@4b013000 has three levels. 
And the innermost, spidev node is to match spidev driver, to create 
spidev(udev) device. I am working on this recently, but got some 
stranger cases. Need more effort and time.

     Harald, do you have any idea about this way? I'm looking forward to 
it. Thanks a lot.

Haixu Cui
