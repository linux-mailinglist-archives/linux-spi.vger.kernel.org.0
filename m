I did not come up with the pattern myself. But from what I can 
understand, the pattern is not random at all, but is carefully chosen to 
target certain ways a read can fail on the controller. So a random piece 
of data won't work as well as this carefully designed pattern.

Yes, vendors can choose any layout, but one partition on that layout 
would be your calibration pattern. I think you can use a different 
compatible for that partition. I have not thought this through yet 
though.

Sorry, I still don't get why you want to tie dirmap and calibration 
together. Just let them be independent and let flash drivers take care 
of when to call what. SPI MEM should not care.
