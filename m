I think this problem fundamentally applies to Octal DTR and above (if 
there is ever 16-line DTR (hexadecimal DTR?) in the future). In your 4D 
data phase, you can only send _one_ byte per cycle. So the byte order 
inter-cycle does not matter as it does in 8D mode. Similarly, for a 
16-line STR this would also apply, since that has 2 bytes per cycle. For 
a 16-line DTR there are now 4 bytes per cycle and so on.

And the BFPT bit that you use to enable this swap also says "Byte order 
in 8D-8D-8D mode". So I really don't think it makes sense for QPI DTR.

I won't nitpick much on the member name as long as the comment 
describing its role is clear enough.
