The 100 characters is a "don't send silly checkpatch fixes" thing not a
target to aim for (see also the ternery operator stuff).  Like I said an
intermediate variable wouldn't hurt, for example for the FIFO trigger
level into a fifo_trigger variable.

This feels like tempting fate but I guess...

Their older SPI block has quite a few issues IIRC, I think DMA was the
big difference between the two but ICBW.
