I'd rather have everything converted to the new approach (we don't want
2 ways of describing the same thing), and I'm not sure you can make the
old macros map to the new solution, so I fear you'll have to patch all
vendors. This being said, I'm fine providing simple wrappers if that
helps, but I don't see how they'd make the description simpler/more
compact to be honest.
