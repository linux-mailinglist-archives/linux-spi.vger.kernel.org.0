Hello Rob, Mark, Tudor & Pratyush,

Here is a sixth versions for these bindings, which applies on top of
the v5.17-rc1 now that Pratyush's work as been merged.
(https://lore.kernel.org/all/20211109181911.2251-1-p.yadav@ti.com/)

Cheers,
Miqu√®l

Changes in v6:
* Added Pratyush's acks.
* The tooling now validates the binding (updating dt-schema is
  necesary).
* Updated the maxItems field to 4 as a "big enough value" as discussed.

Changes in v5:
* Used the uint64-array instead of the matrix type.
* Updated the example as well to use a single "/bits/ 64" cast because
  doing it twice, despite being supported by the language itself, is not
  yet something that we can use for describing bindings.

Changes in v4:
* Changed the type of properties to uint64-arrays in order to be able to
  describe the size of each element in the array.
* Updated the example accordingly.

Changes in v3:
* Rebased on top of Pratyush's recent changes.
* Dropped the commit allowing to provide two reg entries on the node
  name.
* Dropped the commit referencing spi-controller.yaml from
  jedec,spi-nor.yaml, now replaced by spi-peripheral-props.yaml and
  already done in Pratyush's series.
* Added Rob's Ack.
* Enhanced a commit message.
* Moved the new properties to the new SPI peripheral binding file.

Changes in v2:
* Dropped the dtc changes for now.
* Moved the properties in the device's nodes, not the controller's.
* Dropped the useless #address-cells change.
* Added a missing "minItems".
* Moved the new properties in the spi-controller.yaml file.
* Added an example using two stacked memories in the
  spi-controller.yaml file.
* Renamed the properties to drop the Xilinx prefix.
* Added a patch to fix the spi-nor jedec yaml file.
