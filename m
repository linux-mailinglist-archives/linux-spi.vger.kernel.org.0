There is, as far as I'm aware, no "controller" for a mikroBUS. As I
tried to explain, it's a bunch of pins with defined standard functions.
The idea seems to be they're connected to a SoC with a pinmux that can
reconfigure the function of the pin.

At least that's how the hardware implementations I've seen do it.

A board plugged in doesn't have to use all the functions. I gave two
examples. Apart from the power pins,

The GPS board as I stated uses the two UART pins, and some GPS boards
route the PPS signal to another pin on the connector, but that's
entirely optional. Another pin might be used as a GPIO as an enable.

In the case of a relay board I've had, the SPI CS pin is used for one
relay, and the PWM pin for the other relay.

I also have a BME280 humidity/pressure sensor board, which just uses
the two I2C pins.

What is supported by a board is down to the board. Which pins it
connects to is down to the board. Which board is plugged in is up
to the user.

That is essentially the long and short of mikroBUS - I hope I've
given a good overview of it.

I am slightly confused by this series, because it seems the Linux
"mikroBUS" layer requires a one-wire EEPROM on the boards, but the
official mikroBUS specification doesn't state this. The author
really needs to clarify what they are implementing here. Are they
truly implementing mikroBUS as defined by Mikroe, or are they
implementing someone's custom extension to it that adds an
identification EEPROM - in which case I would argue that this
code as it stands is not suitable for mainline as long as it
purports to be implementing support for Mikroe's mikroBUS.

Hence, I think we should back off on reviewing this until we have
that clarification.
