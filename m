Do you have some more details about this mode of operation? I looked a
bit at the MAX14830 datasheet and code, but couldn't spot what allows
an interrupt to be triggered after X bytes have been received *OR* if
data has been sitting in the FIFO for too long.

Yes, there is definitely some significant overhead with all those SPI
transactions. But here I'm mostly concerned about CPU usage rather than
actual bandwidth on the UART.
