Dear Friend,

With due respect to your person and much sincerity of purpose.I wrote
you two days ago expecting that you would reply as regards the urgency
of this proposal that i passed to you.Anyway, I don't know if you did
receive it or not that is the reason I am re-sending it.I have a
business proposal which I will like to handle with you. $35 million
USD is involves. But be rest assured that everything is legal and risk
free as I have concluded all the arrangements and the legal papers
that will back the transaction up. Kindly indicate your interest as to
enable me tell you more detail of the proposal.

Waiting for your urgent response.
Yours Faithfully,
Mrs.bawa mohammed
