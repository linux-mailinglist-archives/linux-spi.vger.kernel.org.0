Would this cover the transient DMA failure that is happening between
SDMA registration and firmware load? This is exactly the case for which
the PIO fallback is triggered for us: As soon as the SDMA driver is
registered, the SPI driver can be probed as well, usually failing its
first DMA transfer, as the SDMA firmware is not loaded yet. We would
still like the SPI controller to use DMA as soon as it's actually
available.

I assume the actual issue is that the SDMA controller is considered
registered before the firmware load has finished, but I have no idea
how feasible it would be to change that (some comments in the code
explain why this currently isn't the case).
