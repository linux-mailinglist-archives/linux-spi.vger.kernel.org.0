After communicating with colleagues in SoC FE, I learned that PCLK and
SSPCLK were homologous on JH7110. He said that SSPCLK would divide the
frequency internally anyway, and there was no need for external part frequency,
so he directly gave them together.

So, should I call this clock ssp_apb or keep it SSPCLK?
