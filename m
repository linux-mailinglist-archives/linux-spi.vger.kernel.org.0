generic devices, no. MFD, no. 

What's needed here is a connector node (and driver) for the mikrobus 
socket. The connector node's purpose is to decouple the host DT from 
add-on board overlay DT. Something like this:

connector {
	// And a more specific compatible if pins can have alt funcs?
	// Spec version needed?
	compatible = "mikrobus-socket"; 

	// Will need regulators defined if child devices expect 
	// regulators
	vcc-33-supply = <&reg33>;
	vcc-5-supply = <&reg5v>;

	i2c-parent = <&i2c1>; // Already a defined property
	spi-parent = <&spi0>; // New

	// RST pin
	reset-gpios = <&gpio 4 0>;
	
	// remap 'INT' (index 0) to host interrupt
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	#address-cells = <0>;
	interrupt-map = <0 0 &gpio 3 0>;

	spi {
		//devices
	};

	i2c {

	};
};

The DT spec defines 'foo-map' properties extending interrupt-map. 
Currently only GPIO is defined. We might want to do the same thing for 
PWM. Or we make the connector node both a PWM consumer and provider.
