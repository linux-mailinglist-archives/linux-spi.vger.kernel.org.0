Which would mean calling it right after :

	ret = spi_nor_create_read_dirmap(nor);
	if (ret)
		return ret;

	ret = spi_nor_create_write_dirmap(nor);
	if (ret)
		return ret;

Why don't you simply choose some random place, first 16KB for instance,
and check that the data is random enough ? If not, declare calibration
not possible and choose a default safe setting which is anyhow a
requirement for calibration. Retry at reboot as data might have changed.

hmm, that might work for some boards. This is not at all the case for
the BMC boards. Vendors can put any kind of flash model and/or layout
and the driver needs to be more generic.

Perfect, we can move the calibration hook in spi_nor_create_read_dirmap()
then, or in devm_spi_mem_dirmap_create(), which would make more sense IMHO.

Thanks,
