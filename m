So essentially we're so slow in filling the FIFO when starting a
transfer that the interrupt triggers in the middle of the initial FIFO
fill?  Something that tricky *really* needs a comment adding.

Ideally we'd just leave the interrupt masked until the FIFO is filled
though, looking at the driver I see that there is an interrupt mask
register which seems to have some level of masking available and I do
note that in rockchip_spi_prepare_irq() we unmask interrupts before we
start filling the FIFO rather than afterwards.  Would reversing the
unmask order there address the issue more cleanly?

If it were just this then there's preempt_disable(), but what's the
problem with being preempted during the FIFO fill?
