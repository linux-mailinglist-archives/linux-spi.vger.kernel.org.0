Yes, I left out the mikroBUS over greybus patches for now since this 
patch series is already too big.

Yes, I will add Co-author and Co-developed tags. I think I should use 
your ti email? I would have preferred to keep you as the author in the 
git commit but I could not get the patches applied cleanly back when I 
tried it.

Thanks, should I just add it in the message body? I cannot see anything 
in docs about that.

I guess I will start with only i2c and spi support and go from there.
