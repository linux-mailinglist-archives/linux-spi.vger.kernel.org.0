Or how about this: we slightly re-structure the interrupt handler such
that all possible interrupt conditions are explicitly handled and
terminate with a return IRQ_HANDLED, and those which are not, including
in the case of a "spurious" (because the interrupt was triggered for
another SPI controller instance), then we finish the function with
IRQ_NONE. This would not impact the performance for the BCM2835/36/37
which would still have a single controller/single interrupt line to handle.
