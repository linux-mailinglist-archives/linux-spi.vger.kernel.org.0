->exec_op() should be implemented by controller drivers, there is a
check_only flag to verify that the operation is supported by the
controller, the entire operation is provided so that the controller
driver knows exactly where we are going and does not try to guess
anything. There is also a parser in the core that allows
"complicated"/"constrained" drivers to just give a number of patterns
they support and the parser will do the job of finding how the
operation should be split.

I believe this was what Boris referred to. If not, please correct me.

Thanks,
