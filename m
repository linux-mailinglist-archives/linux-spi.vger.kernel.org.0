Yes, those would need a device tree overlay, but most mikroBUS add-on 
boards does not need this, almost all the boards need the standard bus 
properties (SPI/I2C properties), IRQ, named-gpios, named properties, 
regulators, clocks and the current implementation supports this.

Looking at the example Andrew provided above (SPI-I2C converter with 
sensors .etc on the I2C bus and GPIO controller) - usually you will not 
find such a mikroBUS add-on board, because if there are I2C devices they 
would directly be on the mikroBUS I2C bus rather than on the converter, 
now someone can do this in their custom solution but then it is no 
different than an I2C adapter on USB/PCIe, does the standard discovery 
mechanism on those buses help instantiate devices on the I2C? my 
understanding is NO and you will need to write a custom device tree 
overlay for the same and same will be the case here.

Agreed, but the comparison need to limited to the expansion interface 
(mikroBUS) under discussion as the idea is not to create an alternate 
interface for describing generic devices, the   class of add-on boards 
that can fit in the mikroBUS add-on board form factor and on the buses 
exposed by mikroBUS requires only simple descriptions - namely standard 
bus properties (SPI/I2C properties), IRQ, named-gpios, named properties, 
regulators, clocks and the extensions to manifest were made for those 
properties only. Also the extensions were done to support the properties 
under unified device property interface under include/linux/property.h
