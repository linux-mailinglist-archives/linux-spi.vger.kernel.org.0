Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: spi: Update the "master/slave" terminology

Update the master/slave terminology wherever possible to adopt usage of
the controller/host/target. Some parts have been left untouched because
they were sysfs entries and will probably end up being inaccurate if
simply replaced here.
