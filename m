Hello Harald,

     In current driver, spi_new_device is used to instantiate the virtio 
SPI device, spidevX.Y is created manually, this way seems not flexible 
enough. Besides it's not easy to set the spi_board_info properly.

     Viresh Kumar has standardized the device tree node format for 
virtio-i2c and virtio-gpio:

 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i2c/i2c-virtio.yaml
 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio-virtio.yaml

     In this way, the driver is unified, board customization only 
depends on the device-tree node. It's easy to bring up spidev automatically.

     Look forward to your opinions. Thanks a lot.

Haixu Cui
