Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Apple SPI controller driver

Hi all,

This short series adds a new SPI controller driver for Apple SoCs.
It is based on spi-sifive. It has been tested with the generic
jedec,spi-nor support and with a patched up input/keyboard/applespi.c
(though we're going to write a new driver for the keyboard; that's a
story for another time).

As usual, I'm splitting off the MAINTAINERS and DT binding changes.
We would rather merge the MAINTAINERS change through the Asahi-SoC
tree to avoid merge conflicts as things trickle upstream, since
we have other submissions touching that section of the file.

The DT binding change can go via the SPI tree or via ours, but it's
easier if we merge it, as then we can make the DT changes to
instantiate it without worrying about DT validation failures depending
on merge order.
