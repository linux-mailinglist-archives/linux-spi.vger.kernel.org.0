How will the ethernet boards ([1], [2]) work? Where do they get
their MAC address from, for example. The DT has some nice properties
for that, but I doubt that will be possible with the manifest files.
I've looked at the manifest file for the w5500 board [3] and to me
it looks like that board will come up with a random MAC address on
each start. Thus, even today, you have some boards which require
a more complex description.

Apart from the discussion whether the manifest is a suitable or
sufficient mechanism to describe the hardware, I think the main
problem with the proposed binding, is that it doesn't follow the
binding Rob was proposing for a socket. If I want to use DT
overlays, how would you describe an add-on board?

The proposal was that the base board has something like

mikrobus: socket {
	compatible =3D "mikrobus-socket";
	i2c-parent =3D <&i2c0>;
	spi-parent =3D <&spi0>;

	i2c {};
	spi {};
};

an add-on board can then have a DT snippet/overlay like the
following:

&mikrobus {
	i2c {
		eeprom@52: {
			reg =3D <52>;
			compatible =3D <atmel,at24..>;
		}
	};

	spi {
		sensor@0: {
			reg =3D <0>;
			compatible =3D <foobar>;
		};
	};
};

That should be possible with a binding for the mikrobus, which
in fact it is just a pin header with a standard pinout. Also as
Russell pointed out in v3, the EEPROM/manifest is not part of the
mikrobus standard. So maybe that deserves an own compatible, like

   compatible =3D "mikroe,click", "mikrobus-socket";

Or maybe click-eeprom? Although click seems to be the brand name of
MikroElektronika.
