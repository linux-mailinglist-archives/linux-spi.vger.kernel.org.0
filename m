Right, it's leaving landmines lying around - it's hard for me to be
confident that we couldn't also get another surprise due to a new test
case exercising the code differently somehow, never mind the fragility
of the code.

The goal here is to ensure that the clock framework's idea of what the
programmed configuration is and the SPI driver's idea of what that is
can't get out of sync - instead of saving the value by virtue of reading
it back out of the hardware at some specific point and hoping that
there's never any changes triggered by the clock framework between the
save and restore the driver is getting notified whenever there's a
change being made and can update the cache then.  That way we ensure
we can't miss any cases and things are robust.
