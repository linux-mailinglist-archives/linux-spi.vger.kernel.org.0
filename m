You'll have to go over all those operations to check which ones are
supported by the controller anyway. And it's not like the
classification is complicated since the cmd bus-width+DTR seems to be
the discriminant, and it's stored directly in the operation template.

Not sure what you mean by mixed mode. Are you referring to something
like 1S-8D-8D? IIUC, all we care about is the mode used for the cmd
cycle. I don't think there are commands to switch between stateless
(1S-x[S,D]-x[S,D]) modes (assuming 1S-xD-xD is a thing).

I'm not suggesting to choose the first supported operation and use it
unconditionally, but instead choose one operation per stateful mode
(1S, 2S, 4S, ..., 8D) and use the appropriate template depending on
the mode the flash is currently in.
