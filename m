I *think* it's just exposing the mikrobus connector as an spidev device.
There was a former attempt by Vladimir here [1]. Now as it the nature
of such a connector that you can connect a myriad of devices there, it
doesn't really make sense to have a just particular one described. What
happens if that one will switch from spidev to a real driver in the
kernel? So using "spidev" for the compatible would be the first reflex.
But as described in the spidev driver this is plain wrong (and also causes
a warning/info message it) because it should describe the actual hardware.

Thus I proposed to use DT overlays which are loaded according to what
is actually attached to the header, so a real driver could be loaded.

But there *could* be a sane default which then could be replaced in
an DT overlay. Like "mirkobus-socket" or similar, which might expose
spidev. Actually it is more than just SPI, there is GPIO and resets and
I2C. Maybe it should be an MFD? I don't know. But that is something for
the DT maintainers to decide if they'll allow such "generic" devices.
