If we ever need this there is no problem: the idea here is to provide a
default (and for this one the naming is rather good =) ) helper to do
basic checks. A controller either supports DTR ops or not. If it does
not support them, then this check will fail. But like the Cadence SPI
controller driver does, if only one specific configuration is not
supported by the driver, then the ->supports_op() hook of the driver
should check that beforehand and return an error [1].

As these properties are supposes to be more or less static over the
lifetime of the controller we assumed there was no need for something
more dynamic. Anyway this is a default helper, drivers are pleased to
implement their own if needed. Plus, doing so prevents the need for
hacking into dozens of drivers, which is certainly the reason I
personally like the most :p
