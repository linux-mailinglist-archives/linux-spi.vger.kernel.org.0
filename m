Yeah, I don't like the idea of leaking spi-mem information into the spi
controller structure, while there is a structure (so far only
containing hooks) that is dedicated to spi-mem operations. Extending
this structure to contain capabilities appeared the right choice to me.
But on the other hand this is a controller information anyway so if you
both prefer moving this data into the SPI controller structure I'll find
a way to do it.

Thanks,
