As additional background:
When I refactored and extended the fsl-espi driver my test device was
a P1014-based WiFi router (running at 800MHz CPU clock). I still use it
and operate the SPI NOR (s25fl128s) at 50MHz in dual read mode
(with a 4.9 kernel). I never had a problem. 
If the issue now occurs on a system with most likely faster CPU and at
a much lower SPI bus frequency, then something must have a significant
impact on interrupt performance. However I can't say exactly which kind
of interrupt issue should cause the SPI issue we see.
