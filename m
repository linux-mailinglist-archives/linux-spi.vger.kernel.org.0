But you don't know that ROM will always access the flash in single bit 
mode. For example, ROM on some TI SoC can read SFDP and use 8D-8D-8D 
mode for reading images from flash. If you want to flash data from 
Linux, and it byte swaps, ROM won't be able to read the images properly.

This can only work when everything that reads/writes in 8D mode does 
byte swapping. Otherwise it will lead to a mess where data is read 
correctly by some software but not by some other software. I don't know 
how practical it is to make this assumption.

I checked the datasheet of the Cadence Quadspi (spi-cadence-quadspi.c) 
controller. I don't see any such option.

From all I understand of this, it looks to me that this can't really be 
solved completely. If you want to allow compatibility with 1S-1S-1S mode 
then you lose compatibility with 8D-8D-8D software that doesn't do this 
swap. So the question really is which one we consider "more important". 
In my eyes the choice is arbitrary.

But I am not convinced that adding a Kconfig option is the right thing 
to do. I think that would cause too much confusion. It is entirely 
possible that your data gets corrupted going from one kernel version to 
another depending on how it was compiled. Us SPI NOR developers know 
this tiny detail but other people won't, and it would be hard to explain 
this to them.
