This is not something that most drivers are expected to use, cs_change
should only be being used at all for very unusual hardware and it should
be used even less frequently for the last transfer in a message.  It is
fragile and anyone using it really needs to know what they're doing but
the feature is there.

The feature predates me working on the SPI stack, the obvious examples
would be a device that doesn't actually use chip select where you want
to avoid all chip select changes or if you need to do some other actions
in the middle of a SPI transaction for some reason (which would need a
bunch of system level considerations to actually be safe/sensible like
making sure you're not sharing the SPI bus).

Please fix your mail client to word wrap within paragraphs at something
substantially less than 80 columns.  Doing this makes your messages much
easier to read and reply to.
