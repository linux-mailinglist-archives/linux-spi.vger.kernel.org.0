Dear Sir/Madam,

I have investor that want to invest $6.8 Billion into a  company that
needs fund  for expansion only.He can not invest the money to new
Companies that want to start up but into Companies that has been
making good profits but needs funds for EXPANSION. He can only invest
in start up if the investment proposal is realistic. The investor is a
former Petroleum Minister.

His Area of concentrations are Real Estate, Biotech,Textiles ,
Information technology, Pharmaceuticals , Oil & Energy Industries,
Mining &Metals Industry, Management Consulting Industry ,Maritime
industry, Hospital & Health Care Industry, Consumer Services Industry,
International Trade and Development Industry ,Gambling & Casinos
Industry, Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing Industry, Insurance
Industry, Chemical industries, Marketing and Advertising Industry,
Leisure, Travel & Tourism Industry, Agriculture, Aviation, Retail,
Import and Export, Trade and development industry, Real Estate &
Construction Industry and any other viable investment opportunities.

If you recommend a Company to take loan or investment funds from from
my client the investor, me and you will be entitled to 5% of any
amount received by the Company from the investor but if you are taking
the fund directly as a company i will be entitled to 2.5% and you will
retain 2.5% as Global Finder's fee commission. There will be a face to
face meeting between the investor and the investee after signing (MOU)
the (AORI) should not be less than 3% per annul if it's loan or direct
project financing.

Look for a reliable Company that need funding and we can easily make
5% of the amount received from the investor but we need to maintain
absolute confidentiality in the transaction as the fund provider want
to remain silent, so you have to keep it highly confidential between
us.

I will need the company profile and the project summary of the company
that will need funding to present to my investor.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Mr. Moon David.
