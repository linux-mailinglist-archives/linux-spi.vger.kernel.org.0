I believe your fix is correct. In the meantime, more information has been
learned about this hardware, in particular, newer SoC versions and the possibility
to have parallel IO and hardware which uses different chip selects.
I came up with the following patch for supporting this, and it achieves
what you also propose:
https://github.com/bkobl/openwrt/blob/rtl8214qf_merge/target/linux/realtek/patches-5.10/317-spi-cs-support-for-spi-realtek-rtl.patch
It is still is a bit rough, reading it I immediately saw 2 things that
would need to be fixed, but it also improves e.g. that RTL_SPI_SFCSR
is now configured independently of what u-boot did to it.

Cheers,
   Birger
