I find a issue with this implementation, please give corrective suggestions:

In type of op variant listing, there is no way to specify the protocol 
of the op in the variants struct itself.
     - This will lead to filtering/sorting/searching of ops for finding 
the protocols in the spinand core
     while in spinand_match_and_init(), which I don't feel is a good way 
for protocol based op categorization.
     - This would also lead to complexities in cases of mixed mode 
operations.
     - In addition, we can't simply choose the first supported protocol 
in each op id, as some ops have
     intendependency of protocol with other ops. This is because 
non-data ops (like reset, block erase..)
     cannot be in different protocols at same time, so it would make 
sense to have some form of protocol
     based arrangement while listing them.
