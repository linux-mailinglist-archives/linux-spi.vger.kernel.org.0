Unfortunately I don't have any datasheets to propose, I think this mode
must be seen like a controller abstraction of any device with several
physical cs.

The question: "should these properties be common to all devices" is
still open, I don't have a strong opinion, whether we should make these
Xilinx specific, or not. For now they are, but in the near future, it
is not so sure (and my crystal ball is under maintenance ;) ).

Thanks,
