I made the assumption that dies would be identical in order to use this
mode. However, if you think this is too risky I see two alternatives:
* Keep the bindings as I proposed and if we ever have the case, add
  another property, something like:
	stacked-memories;
	stacked-sizes = <x>, <y>;
* Merge these two properties into one:
	stacked-memories = <x>, <y>;

But TBH I prefer the former solution for these two reasons:
1/ You need to know the devices exact geometry when writing the
   bindings while this is something that is usually let to the core and
   the hardware designers.
2/ I am not sure this is really a valid use case. If we ever need to
   concatenate two devices, in particular if they are different, I
   would prefer reviving the mtd-concat series which, besides lacking a
   dynamic discovery feature, is almost ready to be used. Plus, adding
   too much complexity to the core logic (such as handling different
   die sizes) might impact negatively the overall performances even for
   simpler devices.
