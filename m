Dear Friend,

I know that this message will come to you as a surprise. I am the
Auditing and Accounting section manager with African Development
Bank,Ouagadougou Burkina Faso. I Hope that you will not expose or
betray this trust and confident that I am about to repose on you for
the mutual benefit of our both families.

I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of($39.5)million
to your account within 10 or 14 banking days. This money has been
dormant for years in our Bank without claim.I want the bank to release
the money to you as the nearest person to our deceased customer late
Engr. George Granfre who died with his wife and two children on the
21st day of April 2010 in car clash.

I don't want the money to go into government treasury as an abandoned
fund. So this is the reason why I am contacting you so that the bank
can release the money to you as the next of kin to the deceased
customer. Please I would like you to keep this proposal as atop secret
and delete it if you are not interested.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will give you full details on how the
business will be executed and also note that you will have 40% of the
above mentioned sum if you agree to handle this business with me.

I am expecting your urgent response as soon as you receive my message

Best Regard,

Mr Mark Donald
