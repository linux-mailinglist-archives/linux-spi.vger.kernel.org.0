I guess I get it now. You marked those properties as deprecated so that
users stop using them and rely on the driver based compatible values,
but at the same time you allowed the devicetree properties to have a
higher priority than the driver based compatible values in case one
really wants/needs to use the dt properties. I don't have a preference
here, I guess it's fine.

Thanks for the explanations!
