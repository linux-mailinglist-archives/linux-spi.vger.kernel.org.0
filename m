I don't like your tone. Patches are welcome to fix deficiencies in 
documentation. Out of the hundreds of bindings a year, I see <5 
documentation patches a year.

The documentation clearly says to run 'make dt_binding_check' and that 
was obviously not followed here.

Generally the guidance is to look at newer drivers for current best 
practices.

So if they are all 'the same', then I expect they all have a fallback 
compatible with x1000 and using that for the filename makes sense.

So backwards compatible? If so, then they should have x1000 for 
fallback.

Covering all 3 versions? If so and not backwards compatible, then I 
would agree.
