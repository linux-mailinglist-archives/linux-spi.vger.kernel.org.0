most mikroBUS add-on boards in production lies in the category of 
sensors, displays, connectivity, mixed signal (ADC/DAC .etc) and if you 
look at the existing bindings under bindings/iio/ , most devices need 
only simple descriptions and the properties are mainly standard bus 
properties (SPI/I2C properties), IRQ, named-gpios, named properties, 
regulators, clocks the extension to manifest was made taking this into 
account and the named property description interface just maps the 
manifest entries to the unified device property interface under 
include/linux/property.h

I did the survey in 2020, close to 600 board did not have Linux support 
and 150 board had support then, the boards which did not have Linux 
support was mostly because there was no corresponding driver present and 
a lot of these were similar to the 150 that had support (IIO sensors, 
ADC, DACs .etc), there is no vendor(Example MikroElektronika) drivers 
being maintained, so I am not sure if there are drivers working around 
limitations of manifests , but for the 150 boards that we have tested 
support we never had to make any changes to the underlying device 
drivers to be supported.

They are very similar and all the details you mentioned are correct, I 
will provide some comments on the DT proposal you made and why we could 
not implement that approach initially, primarily it is because PCIe and 
USB has OF device tree support and USB interface nodes are children of 
USB device nodes and there is some hardware parent we can tie USB 
interface to and share/derive the of_node, but in case of greybus we 
could not find such mapping - looking at your proposal that is more 
maintainable in the long term, have some doubts regarding the proposal 
will post in the other thread.

Thanks and Regards,
Vaishnav
