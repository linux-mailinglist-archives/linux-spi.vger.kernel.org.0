Hi Vinod, Mark, Shawn,

with this revision I think this series is ready to be picked up, at
least I couldn't spot any blockers anymore.

How would you like to deal with this? While the complete series is
needed to fix the issues and restore proper DMA functionality on
unaffected SoCs, there are no dependencies between the patches
targeting different subsystems.
Do you prefer to pick dma/spi/dt patches from this series in your
respective trees, or do you want the whole series to go through the imx
tree? AFAICS all dma and spi patches are already acked, so taking them
through one tree would be possible, I think.

Regards,
Lucas
