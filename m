Sure, I'll change it if you insist :)

I think it's quite readable at this point (especially with the comment 
above explaining it anyway). Note that these days a lot of people 
consider lines up to 100 chars okay in the kernel, and checkpatch uses 
that limit. Do you have a specific change in mind?

I think if they haven't changed it by now they probably won't; e.g. they 
tacked on DMA using a coprocessor instead of changing the block itself. 
I don't think Apple uses SPI for anything performance-critical. They 
don't even bother with QSPI for the NOR flash (which is mostly only used 
for bootloaders and variable storage).

You mean the *two* Samsung drivers? :-)

It seems Samsung like to keep making up incompatible SPI blocks. This 
one shares a *few* bits in a *couple* registers with spi-s3c24xx driver, 
which point to a common lineage, but those registers aren't even at the 
same addresses. Not enough in common for it to make sense to try to use 
one driver for both (unlike with UART, where it was close enough to be 
added as a new Samsung UART variant, or I2C, where we could refactor the 
pasemi driver to add a platform backend alongside the existing PCI 
support and mostly use it as-is).
