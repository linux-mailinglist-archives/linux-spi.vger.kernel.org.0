On the one hand, the revision is being used to distinguish the board. 
More precisely, the feature ID id determining the actual hardware 
involved, altera-spi connected to a particular indirect register mailbox. 
This is a different feature id used by the n3000 which has a different 
indirect register mailbox with a NIOS hanshake.  So in this case the revision
is being used to specify remote end of the SPI connection, d5005 BMC vs. 
n5010 BMC.

I think in this case 4 bits is enough.  We've only had two instances 
of this hardware in 5 years.  Certainly any future instances of this
hardware should have a register describing the remote end of the SPI 
connection.  This hardware change would then require a new feature id.
