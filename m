Yes, we are developing an HDA sound driver for the HID CSC3551,
which is used for laptops that use SPI or I2C.
And in that series is where we plan to put a patch to add that HID.

The series is this one https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/11/23/723, but
the SPI HID was not ready to be sent in that version, but will be
part of the next submission.

yes, a single _CRS with 2 or 4 SpiSerialBusV2 inside.

No, the minimum number SpiSerialBusV2 or I2cSerialBusV2 inside the
_CRS is two.

No, we only want to multi instantiate SPI or I2C devices from a single _CRS.

We sent a request to the laptop vendor about releasing the SPI DSDT, and 
after that gets cleared, we will send it to you for review. That will 
likely be next.
