Hi,

Modules are loaded by userspace, e.g. udev. It does so based on hints 
that are embedded in the module, these are called MODALIASs. When udev 
sees a device without a driver it will check all the modules to see if 
they have a matching modalias for the driver and then load the module.

In your driver you define the modalias usually using 
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(type, table). E.g. for a SPI driver the type would 
be spi and will take a reference to the spi_device_id table for your 
driver. In addition if you are using devicetree you do the same for the 
of_device_id table with `of` as the type.
