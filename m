Ah, I think I understand what's going on now. That's... really ugly :(

Looking at the SPI core code, I think a better way to handle this would 
be to have your fallback path call spi_unmap_buf() directly (or perform 
the same actions, if exporting that to drivers is unacceptable), then 
make sure ->can_dma() returns false after that such that spi_unmap_msg() 
won't try to unmap it again. That's a lot more reasonable than trying to 
fake up a DMA_TO_DEVICE transfer in the middle of a DMA_FROM_DEVICE 
operation on the same buffer.

Alternatively, is it feasible to initiate a dummy DMA request during 
probe, such that you can detect the failure condition and give up on the 
DMA channel early, and not have to deal with it during a real SPI transfer?

Robin.
