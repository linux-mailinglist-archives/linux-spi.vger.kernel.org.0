That explains a lot, thanks! It's a pity it was not described here.

spidev device nodes are in general allowed, using the specific
compatible for a real device attached to the SPI.

Here it seems clearly that it's not the case. Using roghm,dh2228fv as a
"spidev" compatible for something else was wrong.

Adding another device - sx1301 - also does not look correct, if it is
not there.

I think if you have DT overlay, you can add device node and there is no
need for placeholder, right?

Best regards,
