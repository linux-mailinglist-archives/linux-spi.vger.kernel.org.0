A driver could call a user-space helper, which will read the EEPROM
content (or maybe the driver already passes the content to the
helper), translate it to a DT overlay, and load it. Wouldn't that
work?

I'm not saying that is the way to go, just evaluate some ideas.

FWIW, I'm not talking about manual steps here. But more of
call_usermodehelper(). Or maybe udev can do it?

Btw, [1] mentions hot-plugging. Is that really hot-plugging while
the system is running? How would that work?

I see this as an opportunity to improve the in-kernel overlays :)

But does the manifest have the capabilities to express all that
information? To me it looks like just some kind of pinmux, some
vendor strings and a (DT) compatible string.
[coming back to this after seeing [2]: there are more properties,
but it seem just be a list of property=3Dvalue]

What I'd like to avoid is some kind of in-kernel mapping list from
manifest to actual driver instantiation.

I guess you'll get much of that with DT overlays already and if you
have some kind of automatic translation from manifest to DT overlay,
it will still be plug-and-play. You could fix up any missing
properties, etc. manually loading some manifests/dt overlays for
modules without EEPROMs.

Again, a more complex manifest file would really be appreciated
here. Not just a simple "there is exactly one trivial SPI device on
the bus".

FWIW, here is a more complex example [2] which uses the ssd1306
display driver. Dunno if that is a good example, as it seems to use
the fb_ssd1306 driver (at least that's what I'm deducing by reading
the driver-string-id) in staging and there is also ssd1307fb.c in
drivers/video/fbdev. But how are the additional information like
width and height translate to the properties of the driver (device
tree properties, swnode properties, platform_data*)?

On a side note, does the manifest files use the (linux) kernel
module name for the driver-string-id?
