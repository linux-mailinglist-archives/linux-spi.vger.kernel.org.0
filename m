Hello Harald,

     Some updates:

         1. the virtio-spi device node intermediate layer, "spi", the
            compatible is not "virtio,device45", should be
            "virtio,device2d", shall be in lower case hexadecimal.

         2. the driver should support the way that creating the spi
            device via device-tree, but now the driver doesn't, it cannot
            parse the child node. I guess this is due to the missing of
            of_node property, please refer to the i2c virtio driver.

 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-virtio.c?h=v6.8#n216

         3. in current driver, spi_new_device to create spi devices, as

+        for (csi = 0; csi < ctrl->num_chipselect; csi++) {
+		dev_dbg(&vdev->dev, "Setting up CS=%u\n", csi);
+		board_info.chip_select = csi;
+		/* TODO: Discuss setting of board_info.mode */
+		if (!(priv->mode_func_supported & VIRTIO_SPI_CS_HIGH))
+			board_info.mode = SPI_MODE_0;
+		else
+			board_info.mode = SPI_MODE_0 | SPI_CS_HIGH;
+		if (!spi_new_device(ctrl, &board_info)) {
+			dev_err(&vdev->dev, "Cannot setup device %u\n", csi);
+			spi_unregister_controller(ctrl);
+			err = -ENODEV;
+			goto err_return;
+		}
+	}

           but when I add spi device node in device tree, there will be
           conflicts here, between the device dynamically created via
           device tree node and the device static created by calling
           spi_new_device. As far as I am concerned, it's necessary to
           support of and(or) acpi.

         Let's discuss this topic firstly. Thanks a lot.
