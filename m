Looks great! Thanks for doing this work C=C3=A9dric.

I reviewed all of the patches. The device tree and defconfig ones,
which we will send via my aspeed tree, are good to go.

The others look good too, to the best of my knowledge.

I'll do some more testing of your v2 when you send it out.

Cheers,

Joel
