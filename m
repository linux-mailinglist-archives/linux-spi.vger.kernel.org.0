I do not understand what you mean. For EEPROM supported boards, user 
space is not involved. The driver can directly read the manifest from 
add-on board and setup everything, so it is plug and play.

The manual involvement of user space is only for non EEPROM boards since 
we do not have a way to identify the board without the user needing to 
provide the manifest.

Set RST GPIO to low. clickID supported board will enter ID MODE, Then 
check if CS line has a w1 gpio bus.

Greybus is a communication protocol designed for modular electronic 
devices. It allows different parts of a device to be hot plugged (added 
or removed) while the device is still running. Greybus manifest is used 
to describe the capabilities of a module in the greybus network. The 
host then creates appropriate bidirectional unipro connections with the 
module based on the cports described in the manifest. I have added a 
link to lwn article that goes into more detail.

BeagleConnect simply allows using greybus over any bidirectional 
transport, instead of just Unipro.

I cannot comment much about how greybus handles missing properties. 
While greybus also works just in kernel space, greybus protocols are 
inherently higher level than kernel driver, so it might have an easier 
time with this.

I have also added a link to eLInux page which provides rational for the 
mikroBUS manifest. But the crux seems to be that dynamic overlays were 
not well-supported back then. Also, the use of mikroBUS using greybus 
subsystem was already used. Hence the mikroBUS driver.

Greybus is not a big blocker from my perspective, since it is always 
possible to introduce a new protocol for mikroBUS in Greybus spec. I 
think as long as both EEPROM and non EEPROM boards can be supported by 
mikroBUS driver and dt-bindings, are can be used outside of Linux (eg: 
ZephyrRTOS, nuttx, etc), it is fine.

Yes, the concern is valid. Support for validating the manifest is 
nowhere near as good as devicetree overlays. But I think that would be a 
problem with the device rather than the responsibility of the kernel. It 
is up to the manufacturer to have valid manifests.
