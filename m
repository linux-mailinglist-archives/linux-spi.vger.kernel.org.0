Sorry, my community experience is poor.  How many weeks does the
community usually take to review ?  and this time that I waited for six
weeks and then ping.

Sorry, I don't got it, that free ping usually only needs to be sent to
the subsystem maintainer?

Not recommended to use free ping?  or resend the same patch.  If the
patch does not need to be modified, does it require sending the same
patch ?  And the version number remains the same?
