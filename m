It is per-device. The op is generated using nor->read_opcode, 
nor->addr_width, nor->read_dummy, etc. So if you have 2 NOR flashes on 
your system with different opcodes, it would work for both.

The calibration works by reading a known pattern that is already written 
to the flash again and again and seeing what delays work and what don't. 
For that to happen, the controller driver needs to know where the 
pattern is stored. This series does that by looking at the MTD 
partitions. For that to happen, we need to create those partitions 
first, which happens after mtd_device_register().

But I am planning to use device tree to get that information now so this 
should no longer be needed and we can do calibration before registering 
the device with MTD.
