As I understand, SFDP spec(JESD216) is way of describing flash details,
it does not enforce any rules on how flash should "behave". It just
provides info for drivers to discover flash parameters at runtime.
OTOH, xSPI spec (JESD251) lays down guidelines for SW interface,
electrical, and mechanical interfaces. Macronix flash deviates from xSPI
spec but no SFDP per say (unless it claims xSPI compliance elsewhere in
SFDP tables).

I am fine with that, but I want to make sure we are not saying
controllers w/o ability to swap byte order can never support Macronix
like flash in 8D-8D-8D mode.

non DT platforms also have a way to pass HW related data

Actually I have not come across OSPI flash that also supports quad mode.
So, fallback is 1-1-1 for majority of these flashes

Reading SFDP is not the issue but swapping entire image is the problem.
Takes several tens of ms depending on boot image size which is not
acceptable to systems looking at < 100 - 200msms start up times for
quick bootup usecases involving early Display / CAN output etc

Agree with need for consistent view, although if we need to fall back to
1-1-1 mode for a while and switch back to 8D-8D-8D mode then there is
something fundamentally broken.

Yes, but note JESD216 is all about giving hint to softwares  on how
flash behaves, it does not dictate what softwares need to do with it.
So another OS is free to leave these Macronix flashes using native byte
ordering and not swapping on read / write

flasher program would have to use byte swapped image if read is expected
to be in 8D-8D mode

Sounds good to me. We should note this in commit message disabling
8D-8D-8D mode for these flashes.
