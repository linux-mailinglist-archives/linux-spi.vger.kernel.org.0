The delay here is probably fine - the above is a form letter that I send
whenever people ping so it tries to cover all eventualities.  How long
to leave things depends a bit on what the change is, an urgent bugfix is
going to be different from a spelling fix in a comment.

I'm saying it's generally better to ping by resending the patch.
Typically keeping the same version number makes sense when doing that -
people normally say [PATCH RESEND vN] in the subject line.
