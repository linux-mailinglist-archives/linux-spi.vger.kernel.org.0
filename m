OK.

Right, which means that we should probably seek a solution within the
SPI core itself, even if you can only test with spi-bcm2835.c chances
are that the fix would be applicable for other controllers if done in
the core.

Not sure I follow you, if we have the overlay before
spi_register_controller() is called, how can the check there not
trigger? And if we load the overlay later when the SPI controller is
already registered, why does not spi_add_device()'s check work?

How would I go about reproducing this on a Pi4?
