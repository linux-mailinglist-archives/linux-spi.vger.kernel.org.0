It's common, especially given all the automated conversions, but ugly.

That's better but it's still a very long line which is half the issue.

There's currently a bit of a fashion for people with very old SPI blocks
to make incompatible new versions recently, a lot of it seems to be
driven by things like flash engine support.  Sometimes these things end
up getting instantiated together as they have different purposes and the
incompatibilties make the IPs larger.

Have you done a contrast and compare with the Samsung driver?  Given
both this and your comments above about this dating back to the original
iPhone...
