Yes, after discussion with Vaishnav and trying to brainstorm some way to 
do the same thing with dt overlays, it seems that trying to use dt 
overlays will mean need to have completely separate implementation of 
mikroBUS for local ports and mikroBUS over greybus. Additionally, trying 
to put dt overlays in EEPROM would mean they will be incompatible with 
use in local ports and vice versa.

Also, I feel like jumping to userspace can fail for all sorts of reasons 
and undermine the plug and play support that clickID strives for.

Yes, as long as local port is concerned, hot plugging is not 
recommended. However, when using greybus, it is possible to hotplug the 
node that mikroBUS is connected to.

I apologize if I gave the wrong impression, but the ability to enable 
mikroBUS over Greybus is extremely important here. I left out mikroBUS 
over greybus support from this patchset to allow for easier upstreaming 
of a new driver. However, that does not mean it is a secondary goal of 
this patch.

The current mikroBUS manifest is compatible with Greybus manifest, and 
thus is easy to integrate into standard Greybus. Anything suggested here 
still needs to enable support of mikroBUS over Greybus.
