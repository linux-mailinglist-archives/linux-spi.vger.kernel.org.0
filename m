This proposal looks great and would be the ideal solution, but we met 
with few challenges when initially trying to implement something like 
this and had to drop and take the route with minimal development effort 
to just instantiate mikroBUS devices.

 From what we understand, you are recommending to change the manifest 
description format used by greybus to device tree and also add of_bus 
support for greybus - now this will not only solve instantiating 
mikrobus devices on greybus but even complex devices on greybus making 
it a robust solution and using standard tools and support DT offers.

However we have a few doubts:
* For USB or PCIe, to add OF device tree support the parent devices are 
physically present, for example USB device is a child node of USB 
controller (physically description available in a SoC DT) and USB 
interfaces are child of USB devices, how would that hierarchy look for 
greybus devices?
Would it be
USB/UART/transport controller -> AP Bridge host controller -> Module -> 
interface -> bundle -> CPort ?

When this mikrobus driver was initially implemented we could not think 
of such an approach as the SVC and Control functionality were 
implemented in userspace with gbridge ( 
https://github.com/anobli/gbridge ) with a netlink interface to kernel 
greybus, but today there are references to do it completely in kernel ( 
drivers/greybus/gb-beagleplay.c) and your proposal is implementable.

Also with this the manifesto tool which is not very well maintained is 
not necessary : https://github.com/projectara/manifesto

  How do we know if we found a device with unknown manifest if we don't 
read the EEPROM?

Agreed, but on what basis will you load the particular manifest for a 
add-on board if you are not reading the DT overlay (or manifest blob) 
from the EEPROM?

Thanks and Regards,
