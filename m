compatible = "daisy_chain" or compatible ="simple-bus" would be better?
Both could be caught by of_register_spi_devices to populate the daisy
chain. Do you agree that at that level the chip select could be defined?
The reg properties from the sub-nodes (defining actual spi devices)
would be ignored, thus not even needed to be defined.

So, in case of incompatible mode, let's throw an error and remove
devices of the whole daisy chain, maybe?
