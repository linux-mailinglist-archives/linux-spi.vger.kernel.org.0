True. I don't exactly remember how your proposal worked from the
driver side but I imagine having a specific DT property to locate
that pattern in the setup handler and to use it later on is not
too complex.

OK. and that it would become more generic then.

If a partition is required, that's a dependency on mtdpart.

It could be done from spi_nor_probe() after mtd_device_register() with
some spimem handler using the 'struct mtd_partition' for the {size,offset}
parameters.

I know you would prefer a specific handler and that can still be done.
