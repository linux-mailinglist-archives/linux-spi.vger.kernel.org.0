As per (intended) api finalize_current_message should be called before
finalize current message, as all sorts of reordering may occur and data
may get moved arround.

For example you could even transform a spi_write_then_read into a single
spi_transfer using a buffer and then copy the data back to the original
place, whioch would not be supported as is.

In the end it may even make sense to make the dma-mapping also a
spi resource transformation at the right place and move spi_res_release
before the finalize current message.

But obviously that is a bigger change to core we may not be able to
get into the current release window.
