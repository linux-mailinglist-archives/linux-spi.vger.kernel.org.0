What I said then was "it would need a new core feature" which is what
the binding does, I'm suggesting that you also do that for the handling
of the implementation as well.

Actually now I think about it perhaps this shouldn't be a binding at all
but rather something specified by the client driver - presumably any
system using an affected device is going to need these extra clock
cycles so they'll all need to add the same property.

Well, if it can implement transfer_one() without any negative
consequences whichh
