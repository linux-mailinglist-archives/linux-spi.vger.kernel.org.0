I wouldn't call it "a sensible improvement" in this context, but
merely something like "a data-field/property coherency fixup".

Such issues are very unlikely to happen unless somebody would try to
use the dw_spi.reg_io_width field separately from the denoted methods.
If one does, what he would have needed to make sure is that the field
always takes a correct value which would have led to this patch anyway
but at least it would have got a firm justification.

So to speak I wouldn't have bothered with merging the patch now at
least without changing the patch log which would have had to be
reduced to just the first paragraph with additional message stating
that the change just makes sure that the field is in a coherent state
with the DT-property value in order to improve the code
maintainability.
