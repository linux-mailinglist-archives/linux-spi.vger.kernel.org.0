I would not discard the manifest. It exists, it appears to be used by
a lot of devices. So use it. But consider it an 'intermediate
representation'. Take it and transform it to DT.

Looking at:

https://libstock.mikroe.com/projects/view/5435/clickid

there appears to be a name, and hardware revision in the
manifest. Convert that to a string. Run a checksum over the rest of
the manifest, and append that to the string. You can then look in
/lib/firmware for a DT representation which matches.

So DT support for USB, serial and PCIe devices already exists. When
the core enumerates a PCIe or USB bus, it looks in the DT blob for the
vendor:product ID, and associates any node it finds with the
device. It is not used very often, but if you search the .dts files,
you can find examples.

That is for you to decide. I don't know the architecture well enough.

It is rather old, but:

https://lwn.net/Articles/715955/

There is a diagram of the sysfs tree, which looks pretty similar to
what you say above. What is however missing from the diagram is the
Linux devices themselves. Where do the I2C bus, the SPI bus, the GPIO
controller etc appear in the tree?

Maybe look at PCI and USB. Does the device tree representation include
all the bridges and hubs etc. Or does it simply the representation?

You need something to represent the controller. You need modules. Do
you need the details of interface & bundle and cport? Could you
represent them as an address tuple, and just have the devices under
module?

Does gb-beagleplay.c work together with the code in staging? It looks
like the GPIO controller, I2C controller, SPI controller, etc are
still in GregKH "Tree of crap". I don't think it is wise to build on
top of something in staging. So you probably need to spend time to
cleanup that code and moving it into the mainline proper. As you do
that, you could add the code needed to dynamically add nodes to device
tree.
