We already have bitmap_clear(addr, nr, 1), which would call
__clear_bit() without any overhead. So, I think we'd encourage people
to switch to bitmap_{set,clear} where it makes sense, i.e. where the
object is a real bitmap, not a thing like flags. We can even invent
bitmap_set_bit(addr, nr) if needed.

What really concerns me is that our atomic bit operations are not
really atomic. If bitmap doesn't fit into a single word, different
threads may read/write different parts of such bitmap concurrently. 

Another thing is that we have no atomic versions for functions like
bitmap_empty(), which means that atomic part of bitmap API cannot be
mixed with non-atomic part.

This means that atomic ops are most probably used wider than it worth.
I don't know how many useless atomic bitmap ops we have, I also don't
know how to estimate the excessive pressure on cache subsystem generated
by this useless clear/set_bit() traffic. 

Thanks,
Yury
