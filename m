See my other email

bAGA@mail.gmail.com

Note that at one point we did have 64/256 in the driver, but that was
changed in commit fe78d0b7691c0274 ("spi: sh-msiof: Fix FIFO size to
64 word from 256 word").  Diving into the discussion around that patch,
there seem to be two factors at play:
  1. Actual FIFO size,
  2. Maximum transfer size per block
     (up to 2 blocks on R-Car, up to 4 blocks on SH(-Mobile)).
As the driver supports only a single block, it should be limited to
64 on R-Car Gen2/3.  R-Car Gen4 claims to have widened the register
bit field for the maximum transfer size per block, so 256 might be
possible there...

The renesas,{rx,tx}-fifo-size properties date back to the early days
of DT an ARM, when it was assumed that slightly different versions of
IP cores could be handled well using a single common compatible value,
and properties describing the (few) differences.  The pitfall here
is the "few differences": too many times people discovered later that
there were more differences, needing more properties, and complicating
backwards-compatibility.

Hence the handling of different FIFO sizes was moved to the driver based
on compatible values, and the renesas,{rx,tx}-fifo-size properties were
deprecated.  See commit beb74bb0875579c4 ("spi: sh-msiof: Add support
for R-Car H2 and M2"), which shows that there were more changes
needed than the anticipated FIFO sizes.  And more were added later,
see later additions to sh_msiof_chipdata.

So unless it is meant for a configurable synthesizable IP core, where
this is a documented parameter of the IP core, I advise against
specifying the FIFO size(s) in DT.
