Hi all,

I am using a custom SPI controller which I created in my Xilinx MPSoC 
fpga part. On this custom spi controller bus I have one or more SPI 
devices (in my case a custom LTC6951 driver) connected in the devicetree 
under my spi controller.
Because the controller is custom, I wrote the SPI controller driver and 
also some slave device drivers which seem to work.
These drivers are both created as out of tree loadable modules.

My issue is that at boot of my SocFPGA I can see that my SPI controller 
driver is correctly loaded during the boot process but the spi slave 
driver which is connected to my controller does not get automatically 
loaded.
Therefore, I manually need to do a modprobe ltc6951.ko in my case before 
the LTC6951 slave in my case is up and running.

So, it seems like if I do not really understand the spiÂ  slaves 
enumeration process or there is something else that I am missing here. I 
was under the assumption that the slaves automatically get enumerated 
(they are put as slaves under my controller inside the device tree) 
whenever it's master controller becomes alive.

Can anybody clarify this issue for me?

Tnx,

Henk
