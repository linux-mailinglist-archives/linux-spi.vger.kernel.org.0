well, I would really rather keep the training. Else the device would be
crippled and run at low speed. 1/16 HCLK is the default :/

I think we need some more feedback on this proposal [0].

If that's not acceptable, then let's discuss on dirmap_create() and
see if it would be acceptable to do calibration under this hook.
Which is what this patchset is proposing since the spimem interface
offers all the required information to do so.

However, Pratyush would prefer a stable interface, hence [0].

That said, if one day we merge a do_calibration() hook like proposed
in [0], we can change the current Aspeed patchset to use it. That's
why I didn't see the lack of specific calibration hook as a blocker.

I was hoping this one. We would need a comment on the use of the
dirmap_create() hook to clarify.

Thanks !

Cédric
