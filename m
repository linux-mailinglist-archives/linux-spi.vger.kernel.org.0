I really doubt you'll notice the effects of a software byteswap
compared to the actual time taken to do an spi read.

What's the maximum clock rate for spi memory?
Something like 50MHz ?
If the spi controller isn't doing dma then the cpu pio reads
to get the data are very likely to be even slower than that.
(Especially if they are PCIe reads.)
