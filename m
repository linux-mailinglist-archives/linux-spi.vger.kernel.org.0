I've performed read and write tests on the 2600 controllers, and the
driver seems stable at the settings you have in the device tree.

Tested-by: Joel Stanley <joel@jms.id.au>

I've added Tao and John to cc as they have tested the 2400 and 2500,
and I'm sure will be able to provide some Tested-by.

Cheers,

Joel
