Right. I completely forgot about driver_override. I wonder if the warning
should mention that, so users can know how to get it to match again after
commit 6840615f85f6.

Because currently they would notice a change in behavior but may not know
how to make it to work again.

Honestly I would just stop supporting it, since as mentioned it was really
an abuse on the driver model device matching. But I believe that should be
made clear what the situation is. What's actually supported and what's not.
