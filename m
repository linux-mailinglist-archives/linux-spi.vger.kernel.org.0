Yeah, something's off here - at the very least, syncing with 
DMA_TO_DEVICE on the Rx buffer that was mapped with DMA_FROM_DEVICE is 
clearly wrong. CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG should scream about that.

If the device has written to the buffer at all since dma_map_sg() was 
called then you do need a dma_sync_sg_for_cpu() call before touching it 
from a CPU fallback path, but if nobody's going to touch it from that 
point until it's unmapped then there's no point syncing it again. The 
my_card_interrupt_handler() example in DMA-API_HOWTO.txt demonstrates this.

Robin.
