A delay cell I presume. Which if I read the datasheet correctly is
somewhere between 75ps and 225ps per cell *in an unlocked state*.

I don't understand what the intention of this setting in the device
tree is. I does *not* specify the delay of the DLL, rather it specifies
the target value to be achieved by the DLL. And the RM tells the
recommended value is 0xf. Which makes sense, because it's half a clock
cycle and you'd want to sample in the middle of the clock (note this is
double data rate and you are sampling on falling and rising edge). But
and this is the catch I think, the DLL will only lock if the frequency
is >100MHz. Now if the frequency is lower than 100MHz you can actually
set the value manually (see above), but this is not what the driver
does. You'd need to write the manual value into OVRDVAL, not into
SLVDLYTARGET.

So I'm confused. Why can't you just set SLVDLYTARGET to 0xf if the
frequency is larger than 100MHz? How is this supposed to be used?
Do I need to set the value to 0xf if the frequency is higher than
100MHz? I see you used 4 in your device tree, why don't you use
the recommended value?

It's delaying the internal sampling clock with respect to the
internal clock (which also drivers SCK then). With that clock
the data written by the flash device is then sampled. Now there
is also the read strobe; I'm unsure if that can also be delayed.

Time units depend on the frequency (or changes with the frequency),
whereas the phase angle doesn't.
