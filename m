Well, I think the described concept of the daisy chain doesn't apply
here then. In principle, we can have different SPI devices, where each
is served by a different driver. Together, they create a long register
through which data is shifted. IMHO, the fact that the given device is
on the daisy chain with other devices should be transparent for its SPI
device driver and handled at the level of the SPI subsystem: at SPI
write/read stage, the SPI subsystem would combine message of a addressed
device with the specific no-operation pattern of all other devices being
present on the chain (each device may have its specific no-operation
pattern).

At the moment, I wouldn't try to address a few SPI devices in a single
access.

As you can see, it's no really a mux access like in case of e.g. I2C:
there, we have a physical device performing multiplexing. Once the I2C
bus is switched, no extra effort is required in communication between
the I2C master and I2C device (slave).

I have been thinking about it and came to a similar idea. However, I
didn't find a straightforward way to associate the SPI devices with the
abstract daisy-chain device which would then eventually be linked with
the SPI controller. It would a simple and clean implementation then: SPI
devices at write/read would call daisy-chain device which would create a
full message and pass it to SPI controller. The issue is that the SPI
device requires for all calls SPI controller. It implies that SPI
daisy-chain would need to be SPI controller as well. However, I think
currently the SPI concept in the kernel is fixed: SPI controller <-> SPI
device and there is no place to implement SPI controller <-> SPI
controller (daisy-chain device) <-> SPI device. Any suggestions on how
to address it?

Well, the idea was that the daisy chain will be populated basing on all
sub-nodes and their order in the device tree. If we go for a reg
numbering the device in the chain, I think we need then
'#daisy-chained-devices' as well, such kernel knows a priori the length
of the chain and can issue an error in case some reg values are missing
on a given chain.

Adrian
