Hi Mark,

About this topic of ACPI having no method to describe device buswidth in 
the resource descriptor, it may be an idea for me to raise a Tianocore 
feature request @ https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/

There seems to be an avenue there for raising new features for the spec. 
I (or my org) can't participate in AWSG.

I would have no concrete proposal for spec update for now, though. 
Hopefully others with more expertise could contribute.

In the meantime, I have an RFC for using DMI to quirk support for this 
on the driver - I can share when ready.

Thanks,
John
