Again, 2 cycles. The overhead of a static key alone is at least 50% of 
that. And that's not even considering whether the change in code layout 
caused by doubling up the IRQ handler might affect I-cache or branch 
predictor behaviour, where a single miss stands to more than wipe out 
any perceived saving. And all in code that has at least one obvious 
inefficiency left on the table either way.

This thread truly epitomises Knuth's "premature optimisation" quote... ;)
