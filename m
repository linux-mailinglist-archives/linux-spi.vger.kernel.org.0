I'm also quite shocked and even baffled about how this has been
handled. This is not how leaders should communicate difficult or big
decisions. It's the most disappointing event I have witnessed in the
project.

There is the form and there is the content =E2=80=93 about the content one
cannot do much, when the state he or his organization resides in gives
an order.

But about the form one can indeed do much. No "Thank you!", no "I hope
we can work together again once the world has become sane(r)"... srsly,
what the hell.

No idea why they felt the need to do it that way, but it certainly is
not the open source way, neither is it decent or honorable.


That said, thank you for all your work, Serge!

I believe that nothing that has been accomplished with a candid mindset
and decent intentions is ever done for nothing, although it often pays
off way differently than expected.
So I hope this will be the case for you, too.

Take care,
Philipp
