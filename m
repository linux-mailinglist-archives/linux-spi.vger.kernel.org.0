The current ->runtime_suspend() implementation would indeed (probably)
work for suspend-to-RAM if it wasn't for the wrong pointers to cqspi
and spi_controller (see side note from commit message).

I've not found a moment where `struct cqspi_st` embed `struct
spi_controller` at its start, so I do not believe this has ever worked.
It might be the result of a mistake while porting a patch from a branch
that included other changes.

That does indeed sound like the right approach. Runtime hooks can be
called from suspend/resume if needs be. Runtime PM then gets disabled
at the late stage.

I do not believe currently system-wide suspend can be working.
spi_controller_{suspend,resume} are being called with a bogus pointer.
This makes me ask: should the system-wide suspend/resume part be
addressed with this patch or a follow-up? It feels like a separate
concern to me.

The nice thing is that I have easy access to J7200, which uses the same
controller and supports suspend-to-RAM. That should make it a good test
setup.

Thanks,
