Hi Russell,

I had originally worked on this and will try to provide
some more context which is missing in this series. I am
replying from my TI email as I am active here.

Yes, MikroE owns the standard but they do not prevent anyone from 
creating new add-on boards or adding the sockets in commercially 
available boards, with the only condition that custom mikroBUS add-on
boards cannot be marketed with the name "click" board.

The same series actually can support mikroBUS add-on boards without 
EEPROM as well, it exposes a sysfs interface similar to i2c new_device,
so all you need to do is to plug-in the add-on board, the pass the 
manifest using this interface.
Example :
cat /lib/firmware/mikrobus/AMBIENT-2-CLICK.mnfb > 
/sys/bus/mikrobus/devices/mikrobus-0/new_device

Reference: 
https://docs.beagleboard.org/latest/boards/beagleplay/demos-and-tutorials/using-mikrobus.html#what-if-my-add-on-doesn-t-have-clickid

I am not sure if passing binary manifest blob using the sysfs interface 
is an ideal solution, but the driver can support boards without EEPROM.
Actually the 150+ boards we have validated in the past did not have 
EEPROM on all of them : 
https://github.com/MikroElektronika/click_id/tree/main/manifests

Yes, the pain point with creating device tree overlays for mikroBUS 
add-on boards is that you need an almost new overlays for each 
permutation of the hardware (150+ add-on boards with driver support in 
Linux connected on just BeagleBoard platforms like BeaglePlay[1 port], 
PocketBeagle [2 port], mikroBUS cape on BB black[4 ports]) is more than
1000 overlays to maintain, this driver aims to split the platform 
aspects of mikroBUS (pinmux, SPI/I2C/GPIO controller .etc) from the 
add-on board information, thus requiring one device tree overlay per 
port and just a single manifest describing the add-on board.

The reason for choosing greybus manifest for the identifier is that so 
far we discussed only about physical mikroBUS ports on the board, but we 
can also have mikroBUS ports on a remote microcontroller appearing on 
host over greybus and there a device tree overlay solution does not work 
as the standard identifier mechanism is greybus manifest, some details 
on the remote greybus mikrobus port is available here:

https://docs.beagleboard.org/boards/beagleconnect/technology/index.html

Here is an old video of the concept working: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKrCRRuCw3c

To summarise, the driver with proper fixes and feedback incorporated can 
support mikroBUS Click ID boards(plug and play), existing mikroBUS 
add-on boards (with a clean way to pass the manifest to driver, slight 
manual intervention compared to click ID boards) and also mikroBUS 
add-on board connected to a remote microcontroller appearing over 
greybus (not part of the series, but mentioning it so that it is clear 
why greybus manifest is chosen as the descriptor format).

Thanks and Regards,
Vaishnav
