Thank you, yes we tested mainly for the SPI cases(Master and Slave mode), there
we saw a peak delay of 400ms for transaction completion and this varied with CPU
load, after adding the patch to not wait for DMA TX completion and use EOW
interrupt the peak latency reduced to 2ms.

Sure I will add this in the next revision.
