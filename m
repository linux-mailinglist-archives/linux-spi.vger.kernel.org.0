And I don't think this is a good idea given that the alternative is
just working.

Thinking about this again. I'm not sure this additional compatible
really helps the discovery. It's a chicken egg problem. Only the
modules knows if it has an EEPROM, but then, we already have to
know it's in the socket. So while it might help for a static
configuration, it does not for the discovery.
