Linus was long time ago against board files. Yet, we have a few old
(kinda supported) boards left in the tree. The conversion makes the
driver be prepared for the DT conversion when it happens. From maintenance
perspective my patch reduced the code under the maintenance, which reduces
time spent by both contributors and maintainers on this.

AFAIU all what you are moaning about is type checking. Okay, I got
it, but we have a lot of other places with similar approach done,
e.g. GPIO_LOOKUP*() tables that basically gives something unconnected to the
driver without any platform data being involved and you seems to be fine with
that:

$ git log --oneline --no-merges --grep 'Mark Brown' -- arch/ | grep 'GPIO desc'

I randomly took this 366f36e2a ("ASoC: wm1250-ev1: Convert to GPIO descriptors").

Can you tell how it is different to my proposal?

Okay, let me incorporate those into v3.
