The core provided ecc strength may be smaller than the
calculated one. e.g. A nand chip may only have a requirement
of 8/512bits ECC. But if it has a 2k+128 pagesize, this
controller can do 12/512bits ECC and the bootrom expects the
latter.

I'll take the user requirements if there is one. If there isn't, I'll
follow the calculated strength instead of the device requirement
so that user doesn't have to specify a custom strength in dt.

I did. the setup_pagefmt is called once with the minimal page+oob size
in probe.

I was using the devm api for this allocation so kernel should take
care of that.

I'll change the DMA to use streamed API in the next version to avoid
an extra memory copy in reading, and the allocated buffer will be
freed in remove().
