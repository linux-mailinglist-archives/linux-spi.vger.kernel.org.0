SPI NOR knows what protocol and opcodes it would use before it actually 
puts the flash in that mode. So in theory it could call dirmap_create() 
before it has put the flash in say 8D-8D-8D mode. I don't see much 
reason to do so in practice, but who knows, that might change. This is 
why I would like to hear what other people think.

In practice, no there is nothing incorrect. But as I explained above, it 
is certainly possible to call dirmap_create() before the flash is ready.
