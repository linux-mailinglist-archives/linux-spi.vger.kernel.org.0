Unfortunately the datasheet for the R-Car Gen3 and RZ/G2 SoCs is
not yet public.

However, a very similar hardware block is present in the RZ/A2M SoC.
Please see Chapter 20 ("SPI Multi I/O Bus Controller") of the "RZ/A2M Group
Userâ€™s Manual: Hardware", which you can download from
https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/rz/rza/rza2m.html#documents

Thanks!
