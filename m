On more thing to consider is that if we are using Kconfig things
cannot be changed during runtime. While this might be ok when you
are building your typical embedded distribution, there are efforts
to be able to boot standard distributions on embedded platforms (see
ARM SystemReady). A Kconfig option won't work there.
