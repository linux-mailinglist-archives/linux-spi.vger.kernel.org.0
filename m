So our stance here is that we don't care about external programs?

If that is the case then why bother with all this anyway? Since the swap 
happens at both page program and read, what you write is what you read 
back. Who cares the order stored in the actual flash memory as long as 
the data read is correct?

If we do care about external programs, then what would happen if the
external program writes data in 8D-8D-8D mode _without_ swapping the 
bytes? This would also cause data corruption. You can't control what 
they mode they use, and you can't detect it later either.

I think there is no winning here. You just have to say that external 
programs should write in 8D-8D-8D mode or it won't boot.
