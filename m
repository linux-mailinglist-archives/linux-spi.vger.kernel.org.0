Mh, but below you are saying that Micronix is violating the standard
and is swapping the bytes. So, the standard is actually specifying the
byte order.

Why should it be always enabled? You can also say it should always
be disabled. It doesn't matter if the byte order isn't important.

But I say the byte order *is* important. We need one reference.

Agreed, but I don't think we have to do it now. If someone cares,
he can make a patch. Also we have to consider non-DT platforms.

You can also fall back to a quad mode. Again, can be implemented if
someone cares.

No we are talking about what? ms? to read the sfdp? If that is really
a use case, the the bootloader can hardcode it there.

I strongly disagree here. The kernel should provide a consistent
view of the flash content, regardless if its read in 1-1-1 or 8d-8d-8d.
Imagine you are forced to switch away from 8d-8d-8d mode (for whatever
reason) after some time. How would you know how to read the contents?

JESD216 is a standard, too. There is a reason this bit ended up in
there. If I had to guess, someone messed up the byte order in 8d-8d-8d
but it was too late. And now the standard is giving you a hint that
you are using a flash with that messed up byte ordering.

I want to avoid having flash contents where the byte are swapped.
The sooner we care about that, the better. You cannot undo that
later on.

So what if your flasher only has 1 pin? With this you are just
shifting the problem elsewhere.

I certainly have nothing against an option to turn this all off
to improve speed. But the swapping (if asked to do so) and the
degradation should be an *opt-out*. Not an opt-in. Nobody will
do the opt-in and we end up with 'corrupted' flash contents.
