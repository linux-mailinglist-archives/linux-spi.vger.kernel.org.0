I thought this pattern was pretty much the standard style.

Done. Also changed to "apple-spi" since all the other apple drivers use 
the dash convention.

How about this?

return (200000 * t->bits_per_word * APPLE_SPI_FIFO_DEPTH / 2) <= 
t->speed_hz;

Ack, I switched it to an if chain. That does mean I had to move the 
subsequent initializers out of the declarations section, so it's overall 
a bit more verbose.

	if (t->bits_per_word > 16)
		bytes_per_word = 4;
	else if (t->bits_per_word > 8)
		bytes_per_word = 2;
	else
		bytes_per_word = 1;

	words = t->len / bytes_per_word;
	remaining_tx = tx_ptr ? words : 0;
	remaining_rx = rx_ptr ? words : 0;

With the other devm changes Sven suggested we don't need a remove 
function at all, so I've just gotten rid of it wholesale.

Apple like to keep blocks compatible across SoC generations - I think 
this one dates, at least to some extent, to the original iPhone or 
thereabouts. We do use per-SoC compatibles in the DTs in case we need to 
throw in per-SoC quirks in the future ("apple,t8103-spi", "apple,spi"), 
but for drivers like this we prefer to use generic compatibles as long 
as backwards compatibility doesn't break. If Apple do something totally 
incompatible (like they did with AIC2 in the latest chips), we'll bump 
to something like apple,spi2. This happens quite rarely, so it makes 
sense to just keep things generic except for these instances. That way 
old kernels will happily bind to the block in newer SoCs if it is 
compatible.

If we had a detailed lineage of what SoCs used what blocks and when 
things changed we could try something else, like using the first SoC 
where the specific block version was introduced, but we don't... so I 
think it makes sense to just go with generic ones where we don't think 
things have changed much since the dark ages. FWIW, Apple calls this one 
spi-1,spimc and claims "spi-version = 1" and the driver has Samsung in 
the name... so the history of this block definitely goes back quite a 
ways :-)
