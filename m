I think the correct thing to do here would be to move this patch out of 
your main series. Since the old driver did not have this feature anyway, 
it is not necessary for the conversion to achieve feature parity. Then 
have a separate series to drive the conversation on how to best 
implement this contentious feature.

I interpret it this way because I feel you have ignored my comments and 
have kept this patch in regardless. But maybe I _am_ being too harsh. So 
apologies if I have interpreted things wrong.

Yes please. I would like to have this patch dropped, and then reopen 
this discussion in a separate thread.

I have provided solutions before but maybe you missed them. Please see 
[3]. Specifically patches 1 and 3. These are still not very refined and 
might not be accepted in their current state (especially patch 3 since 
it does the calibration after registering the device with MTD), but they 
should be a good starting point for discussion.

And we might end up deciding to just use the dirmap_create() hook to do 
the calibration, but it is important to have this conversation 
separately and clearly instead of it being missed as part of a large 
patch series.

This is my preferred option, [3] is a good starting point for proposing 
that handler.
