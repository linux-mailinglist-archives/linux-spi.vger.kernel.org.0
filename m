cs_setup is affected, I thought at least that was clear from the patch 
summary :-)

 From spi.h:

* @cs_setup: delay to be introduced by the controller after CS is asserted

So clearly that delay has to happen at the end of spi_set_cs, *after* 
the assertion, not at the beginning before it.

If you prefer, I can resend it with a reference to the spi.h comment.
