These changes have been merged into the Mark' repo in the spi-next
branch:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/spi.git/log/?h=for-next
The series together with the rest of the SPI-related changed will get
into the mainline during the merge window.
For the time being you can rebase your patches on top of the Mark' repo
and if it works well for you just post it out for review. If it looks
good you'll even be able to have your series merged into the kernel in
the next merge-window.
