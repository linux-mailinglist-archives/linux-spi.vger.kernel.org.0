No, this is software control over a single built-in CS line that is part
of the SPI peripheral. You can of course use the GPIO mechanism too,
which has no limit on the number of CS lines. That said, I don't think
Apple uses more than one CS per controller on any current machine, so we
just use internal CS.

The completion? The IRQ handler has to access regs more often than the
completion, so it sounds like the current order should be faster.

Probably not worth it; I could have a function read both registers and
stuff it into a u64, but I think it'd end up being about the same amount
of code in the end with the extra scaffolding.

I'm not entirely sure what the alignment guarantees for SPI buffers are.
Some drivers use unaligned accessors (e.g. spi-uniphier.c), while others
don't (e.g. spi-xilinx.c). That makes me think they're aligned in the
general case (and they usually would be if drivers intend to use them in
16-bit or 32-bit mode; hopefully they're allocated as arrays of those
units in that case).

spi.h has this to say:

 * In-memory data values are always in native CPU byte order, translated
 * from the wire byte order (big-endian except with SPI_LSB_FIRST).  So
 * for example when bits_per_word is sixteen, buffers are 2N bytes long
 * (@len = 2N) and hold N sixteen bit words in CPU byte order.

So endianness should be correct, at least for power of two word sizes. I
also believe it should work for non-POT word sizes, and assuming packing
doesn't change in SPI_LSB_FIRST, also for that case. It's kind of hard
to properly validate this without a real device that uses these modes,
so I think at this point we can just go with the current logic and if we
run into a problem in the future, we can fix it then :)

Yeah, I switched everything to dev_err_probe()

This was cargo-culted from spi-sifive and I noticed it actually causes a
warning to be printed on rebinding the driver to the same device;
already got rid of it :)
