Our problem is not how to detect that we have to swap it, but
rather what we do when we have to do it.

If we have a controller which can swap the bytes for us on the
fly, we are lucky and can enable swapping if we need it. We are
also lucky when we don't have to swap the flash contents, obviously.

But what do we do when we need to swap it and the controller
doesn't support it. We could do it in software which will slow
things down. So depending on the use case this might or might not
work. We can degrade it to a speed which doesn't have this issue;
which might be 1-1-1 in the worst case. We could also do just
nothing special; but this will lead to inconsistencies between
reading in 1-1-1 and 8d-8d-8d.
