Problem with Kconfig is that it cannot be used when there are multiple
flash instances on the board and both behave differently.

This is similar to big-endian vs little-endian property used by CFI
physmap driver and other places in kernel[1]

As I indicated below xSPI (JESD251) spec seems to align on little endian
order. So, don't really need to swap the bytes on read. Anyways impact
on performance prohibits such support and thus most ROM designs will
expect flashing program to take care of it (especially in case where
controller does not support on the fly swapping).

Flash programmer need not change the mode, but needs to generate a byte
swapped image and write it knowing that image is being flashed in
8D-8D-8D mode and read in 1-1-1 mode or vice versa.

See above, no need to change mode dynamically.

I am fine with things being configurable

Only issues with Kconfig: it does not help systems with multiple OSPIs
with different endian-ness.
