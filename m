Oops, I seem to have overlooked this. I think it should've been
spi_controller_get_devdata()

Thanks for the fixes.

I don't know how it worked either, but I had definitely tested and
provided logs at the time of posting the series,

Hmm, could be, not entirely sure now. But I did test it and now don't
know how it had worked with that wrong pointer now that I see that
mistake.

The context was as follows,

The upstream cqspi driver prior to this:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230417091027.966146-1-d-gole@ti.com/
series had buggy suspend resume. That needed fixing hence I added the
first patch that introduced the buggy pointer but somehow still ended up
working after suspend resume.

After that, I also wanted the driver to support runtime_pm. I thought
that both system suspend and runtime pm would have similar requirements
from a driver POV since the IP essentially would turn off and from it's
view would need system suspend like suspend resume calls.

Now that I look at it, perhaps it is best to have 2 seperate calls for
runtime and system pm.

Yes, I think it best that we add a proper system suspend and runtime pm
support for this driver.

Again, thanks for catching this bug and reporting a fix. I also have an
SK-AM62 handy which uses this ospi controller so let me see if I can
help test your patches with system and runtime pm as well whenever you
do post them.
