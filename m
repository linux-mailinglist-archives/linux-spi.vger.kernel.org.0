Indeed that was the main point of the original review from Boris, the
capabilities should be fixed on the controller's lifetime. So I believe
we are safe.

I think I am going to propose the following:
	const struct spi_controller_mem_ops *mem_ops;
+	struct spi_controller_mem_caps mem_caps;

As the structure is not supposed to enlarge dramatically in the near
future, I guess it's fine to have it defined statically. Please tell me
if you prefer a *mem_caps pointer.

I'll send a proposal soon.

Thanks,
Miqu√®l
