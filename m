This would work in most cases when we want to instantiate devices on a 
physical mikroBUS port on the host running Linux, but another use case 
we need to support is to instantiate devices on a virtual/greybus 
mikroBUS port created through greybus, this is the case when a remote 
microcontroller board (Example BeagleConnect Freedom) has mikroBUS ports 
and through the magic of greybus these virtual ports (corresponding to 
the physical remote ports) appear on the Linux host - now we cannot use 
a device tree overlay to instantiate a Weather click (BME280) sensor on 
this port, that is why the choice of extending greybus manifest was 
chosen, another alternative here is to go and add device tree as a 
description mechanism for greybus, please let know if that is the 
recommended way forward?

The greybus manifest already is being used in the greybus susbystem for 
describing an interface and there are already greybus controllers 
(SPI/I2C .etc) being created according to the manifest contents, all 
this driver does is to extend that format to be able to instantiate 
devices on these buses. The primary goals for introducing the driver for 
mikroBUS add-on boards are:

1) A way to isolate platform specific information from add-on board 
specific information - so that each permutation of connecting the add-on 
board on different ports on different board does not require a new overlay.
2) A way to instantiate add-on boards on greybus created virtual 
mikroBUS ports.
3) Both 1 and 2 should use the same add-on board description format.

Standard device tree overlays did not help to achieve this and that is 
why the standard interface discovery mechanism in greybus, the manifest 
was extended even though it is not the most optimal way to describe 
hardware.

This should be corrected, it is not recommended to hot-plug the board as 
the connector standard does not ensure any power sequencing and can 
cause damage.

The property descriptor is implemented to account the properties under 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/property.h#n22 


There is no in-kernel mapping that needs to be updated per driver, but a 
generic mapping and some specific mapping depending on the bus the 
device is connected (I2C/SPI/.etc)

The driver uses device_property_read_* helpers to fetch the infromation 
and the mikroBUS driver populates the table of properties fetching the 
information from manifest and combining with platform information.

The spi_device_id is used for the driver-string-id :
