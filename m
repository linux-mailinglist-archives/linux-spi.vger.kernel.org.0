IMHO it should just work that you can use 1S-1S-1S mode and 8D-8D-8D on 
the
same flash. After all, that is Tudor's use case. The ROM access the 
flash
in single bit mode and linux in 8D-8D-8D mode. Maybe u-boot will use 
quad
mode in between. All of these accesses should return the same flash
content.

Just having and opt-in will be a mess in the future with flashes 
containing
byte swapped content and we can't even fix it and we will have to live 
with
that forever. IMHO right now is the best time to circumvent that 
scenario.
I don't have anything against make it user configurable, but it should 
be
an opt-out.

I haven't looked at any controllers who can do 8D-8D-8D accesses, maybe 
most
of them can do the swapping on their own? So if you don't want to 
support a
software fallback, then we should just say this mode isn't supported if
the controller can't do the byte swapping and we fall back to a slower 
mode.
