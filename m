Ha, and in fact having checked a build out of curiosity, this patch 
as-is actually stands to make things considerably worse. At least with 
GCC 8.3 and bcm2835_defconfig, bcm2835_spi_interrupt_common() doesn't 
get inlined, which means bcm2835_spi_interrupt() pushes/pops a stack 
frame and makes an out-of-line call to bcm2835_spi_interrupt_common(), 
resulting in massively *more* work than the extra two instructions of 
simply inlining the test.

So yes, the overhead of inlining the test vs. the alternative is indeed 
non-zero. It's just also negative :D

Robin.
