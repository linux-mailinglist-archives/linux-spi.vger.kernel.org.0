We can use gpio-sim as the interrupt controller which always exists
with some tiny fix, I had posted them and can be found from link:

The bpftool in kernel still need some works, I am still working on
fix comments from maintainers, which can be found at:

https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/b942bf8f-204b-6bf1-7847-ec5f11c50ca0@isovalent.com/

Base on BPF's map, we can using wrap for read/write registers as
the device's requirement. And it is possible to control each register
and runtime.

For example, simple write data to MTD device, and check whether
the data is write to registers:

def test_write_data(self):
    with self.device() as dev:
         self.device_write_bytes(dev, [1, 2, 3, 4]) <- write to /dev/mtd
         data = self.read_regs(0x00, 4)
         self.assertEqual(data, [1, 2, 3, 4])

I am working on a light weight framework which just 400 loc's python
code, and can do similar tests to roadtest.

Once I finished the bpftool, I will post a proposal.

I saw your other mail, and know you mean roatest, which is based on
virtio as the backend.

The bpf backend can be easily integrate to roadtest.
