I don't quite get why we should put controller specific information
into the memory device structure?

Anyway, do you mind if we move forward first? Not that I don't think
that this choice should be discussed further, but I think this can
easily be changed in the near future if there is a desire to
reorganize spi-mem objects. In fact, these capabilities are accessed
through a helper so that hypothetic change would be almost transparent.

Thanks,
