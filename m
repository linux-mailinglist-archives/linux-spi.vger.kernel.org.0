Ok, I understand what's happening behind the scenes, no problem with
this.

Actually I think this is what could be enhanced: when I use
DT_SCHEMA_FILES the output is always polluted with errors with nothing
(at least from my user point of view) related to the files I am
working on. See [1] for an example of output that I found hard to parse
for errors related to my changes: I am looking for issues in
nand-chip.yaml and (50 seconds later) I get warnings for:
- ilitek,ili9341.yaml
- snps,dwcmshc-sdhci.yaml
- ti,sn65dsi83.yaml
- nxp,dwmac-imx.yaml
- fsl,imx6q-pcie.yaml

Do you think the reporting can be improved?

I understand it's not that easy and takes a lot of time, thanks anyway
for all your work on this topic.

Thanks,
