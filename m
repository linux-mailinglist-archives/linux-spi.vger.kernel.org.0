I wouldn't say the driver "allows" it, so much as it just blindly grabs 
the first clock assuming it's SSPCLK per the binding, and thus it will 
happen to work out if the underlying physical clock is the same as, or 
equivalent to, the APB PCLK. Otherwise, it's already into some degree of 
not working properly, by virtue of reading the wrong clock rate.
