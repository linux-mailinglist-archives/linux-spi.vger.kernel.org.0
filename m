Yes, I'll follow what Rob thinks its best:
- keeping maxItems: 4 (as it is), which is a good enough value
- dropping the maxItems here because in the end no bounding is necessary
- using maxItems: 2 to match the SPI CS even though in theory these two
  numbers are not correlated (stacked-memories might very well be
  used by other non SPI memories as well).

BTW if you're fine with the proposal your Ack is welcome ;)

Thanks,
