Please take care about periods at the end of sentences.
But this is minor in comparison to the following issues:

 - you enable this for existing I²C multi-instantiate devices,
   are you sure it is fine?

 - continuing above, how can you guarantee that the same ID would
   be used I²C and SPI versions of the same chip and not, let's say,
   for UART?

 - or other way around, how do we know that the same component will
   have the same ID for different bus types? (Yes, I understand that
   this is logically appropriate assumption, but you never know OEMs
   and others in their ways to (ab)use ACPI specifications and common
   sense)

 - if we even go this way, it should be under drivers/acpi
