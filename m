Thanks for testing, that confirms it well.

Okay, it was a bit of a shot in the dark. I still can't see what
else has changed.

What would cause this, a lost interrupt? A spurious interrupt? Or
higher interrupt latency?

I don't think the patch should cause significantly worse latency,
(it's supposed to be a bit better if anything because it doesn't set
up the full interrupt frame). But it's possible.

Thanks,
