I have no intention of provoking arguments, I just did *grep -rn "first 
compatible"* in the
Documentation folder after you mentioned the naming rules about "first 
compatible" before,
but just found a "first compatible" in "Documentation/fb/sstfb.rst", but 
It has absolutely
nothing to do with file naming. As Mike and Mark said, my question in 
the previous email
was just out of curiosity about where to look for a detailed explanation 
of the rule.
Since it would be somewhat strange to have two "Ingenic" yaml files with 
different naming
rules in the SPI subsystem, maybe Rob can guide us here?


Thanks and best regards!
