Yes, the related series uses HID CLSA0100, which contains 2 I2C devices =
inside a
single node. This ID was mistakenly used for this laptop, and instead =
CSC3551=20
has been used for subsequent laptops.

Yes, there are several laptop designs which use an equivalent ACPI which =
describes
2 or 4 CS35L41 amplifiers which are connected either via I2C or via SPI.
Both designs use the same ACPI design and have 2-4 devices (either I2C =
or SPI)
defined inside a single ACPI node for HID CSC3551.
Note that the devices inside the node can be either SPI or I2C, but =
never SPI
and I2C.

I hope my colleague Lucas has answered these questions now.

This is the CSC3551 node for a laptop with 4 SPI nodes, with a shared =

This is just our node from the DSDT, we are working to obtain and share =
the full DSDT, if still required.
